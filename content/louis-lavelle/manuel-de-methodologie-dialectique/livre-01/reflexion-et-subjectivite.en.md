## 42. Freedom
**Absolute subjectivity resides in an act that draws from itself its own reasons for acting—that is, in a free act.**

It is obvious that the existence of the self is not that of a pure or absolute subjectivity. It is always inseparable from an objectivity that, to be sure, has meaning only for it, yet limits and hinders it. That is the objectivity of the body and, through the body, of the entire universe. The self is therefore both active and passive; its passivity is a kind of shadow cast by the objectivity of the world onto its own subjectivity. Absolute subjectivity, in which ours merely participates, ought therefore to be identified with an act devoid of passivity. That act can be called a free act, since nothing acting on it from without could determine it. One may therefore say that it acts without cause—which does not mean without reason. That very word reason is precisely the name we use to designate an activity entirely interior to itself, neither a blind force nor a capricious fancy, capable of justifying all its operations by the consciousness it has of them, by testifying that in it alone their roots are to be found. One may say that such an activity, in producing itself, produces its own reasons.

## 43. Adequacy
**Reflection seeks adequacy with the free act without ever attaining it; in the interval that separates them all the objects of experience appear.**

The function of reflection is to abandon the object from which it begins in order to fold the mind back upon its pure creative spontaneity. It never fully achieves this. It is precisely in the interval that separates us from that spontaneity that every object of experience emerges. But those objects, instead of being given simply as they were at first, are always correlated with an operation of consciousness. That operation never succeeds in constructing them completely; they correspond to it even while adding to it, and always appear to it as a true revelation.

## 44. Consciousness
**Regression produces the given and the consciousness of the given.**

Doubtless for there to be any given at all there must always have been an act that gives it to itself. Yet that act did not appear. The task of reflection is to lay it bare. One may therefore say that it is reflection, through the regression it effects, that makes both the given and the consciousness we have of it appear. Up to that point the given failed to stand out as given: it was not given to anyone. There was a perfect coincidence between the operation and its object; but it was the object that absorbed and annihilated the operation. Now, by contrast, it is the operation that tends to absorb the given and make it disappear. Though it never quite succeeds—except abstractly—it nonetheless attempts to do so and introduces a modification into the given, which is no longer the same before and after reflection has been exercised on it, thereby giving both will and thought a purchase on it.

## 45. Power
**Reflection makes sense only for a subject, yet that subject is not a substrate but a power actualized in reflection.**

Reflection separates us from the object only to reveal to us a subject without which there would be no object. Yet the very word subject is equivocal, for it seems to designate a substrate, whereas the subject is not a substrate but a centre of reference to which every object that may be posited must be related. And calling it a centre of reference is not enough, for such a centre could itself be objective. It is an act of positioning that makes itself the centre of positioning. We can grasp it only in its own exercise; that is why it may be defined as a power actualized by that exercise. One may regard this act as taking possession of itself only by turning away from the object—yet it always remains ideally or really in relation with the object; otherwise it would not be a subject.

## 46. Exercise
**That power is known only in its exercise, yet without being confused with it.**

Evidently it is impossible to know that power apart from its actual operation; otherwise it would be indistinguishable from nothingness. That power is therefore always engaged in an experience: that is why it is so often hidden by that very experience and may therefore be denied. It can apparently be brought to light by distinguishing its real operation—meaning the operation by which it recovers a perceptual experience—from its ideal operation, by which it recovers a purely imaginary experience. Here we feel that it can modify that experience almost at will, even annihilate it if it chooses, and that the experience ceases to subsist as soon as the operation is interrupted. We also see that this power does not identify itself with its exercise: it is both their virtuality and their disposition, bearing within itself an infinity that goes beyond every actual or possible operation, containing them all and using them only by a free initiative.

## 47. Perspective
**It is first grasped under the form of a psychological subject that posits itself with respect to its states as engaged in a situation and as the centre of an original perspective on the world.**

The subject discovers itself as subject only in an individual, concrete existence—expressed by the word “I”—that is unique in the world, distinct from every other “I,” feeling states that it alone experiences as its own, constrained to live in time and engaged in an ever-new situation. Such a subject is the centre of a perspective on the world that belongs to it alone and is composed of particular objects that likewise have concrete existence and that it apprehends only through perceptions of a subjective character, each of which expresses only one among the multiple aspects of the object.

## 48. Sensible
**In correlation with the psychological self we encounter the sensible world in the two senses of the word sensible.**

The psychological subject realizes the identity of being and knowing only in itself, inasmuch as it is at once unique and finite. But insofar as it is finite, the existence of the world—and even its own existence to the extent the world limits it—can be for it only given existences. They can be given to it only in such a way that it is affected by them, for it possesses an interiority that is not perfect or self-sufficient. This is equivalent to saying that for it the world can only be a sensible world, and that, as concerns its own being, it is forced to feel that being in both its presence and its modalities before being capable of thinking it and, a fortiori, of creating it.

## 49. Interval
**The sensible world also fills the interval separating the psychological self from the pure self.**

To every consciousness the sensible world presents itself in an individual form, related not only to my physiological organization but also to my past and even to my situation at each instant. Yet I can account, from what comes from me, only for the aspect under which the world presents itself to me—that is, for what I call the perspective through which I view it—and not for its content, for what it offers to my knowledge. That content always exceeds me; it measures my passivity with respect to the world. It fills the interval separating my psychological self from the self that would perceive things as they are and not merely in their relation to its body, the self that would know only their ideas.

## 50. Withdrawal
**Reflection reveals this perspectival character of the psychological subject by placing it within an experience from which reflection itself withdraws.**

After relating the sensible world, or my own states, to an original centre of perspective, reflection can in turn call that subject into question or consider it as an object. To say that I relate the sensible world—or my own states—to an original centre is to say that this “I” is not the same as that centre, that is, the me. For the psychological subject had meaning only through its link with a body that enjoyed the privilege of being the one body that could be considered mine. But my body is part of the world I perceive, and with that world my entire individual or psychological subjectivity is bound up. I therefore withdraw myself from the world of which I was a centre in order, so to speak, to contemplate it from a higher vantage point. Thus the subject becomes dis-individualized even as it becomes dis-incarnate. To consciousness of the object there succeeds a consciousness of consciousness. Only then do I truly leave the world of things to enter the world of spirit.

## 51. Generality
**Reflection then presents itself as the act of a subject that is no longer this or that subject.**

Such a subject, no longer this subject, can be defined as a subject in general. It lies beyond the sensible experience I have of the world and beyond the psychological experience I have of myself. That is why it is sometimes called transcendental. This does not mean that I have no experience of it; rather, that experience is present within psychological experience as the experience of humankind is present within every human being, less as an idea drawn from comparison with others than as the experience of certain potentialities that it is up to me to exercise, that I share with every human being, and to which, through my own act, I will give a form that is unique and individual. This pure self is independent of any particular body, though not of any body whatsoever; it expresses the condition of knowledge for every finite being that has a body before it has this or that body different from every other.

## 52. Incarnation
**This subject nonetheless exists only within the psychological subject.**

One must not disdain the psychological subject in striving to rise above it. There is first a certain essential identity between the psychological me and the pure me, so that it is the same me that rejects, as it were, the particular modes of its own existence that limit and bind it in order to fold back upon its deepest interiority, where one may say that there are gathered, in the indetermination of an act it is up to it to exercise, all the possibilities that can be actualized. But this passage from the psychological me to the pure me is accomplished within the same me, less by a renunciation of the psychological me than by a deepening of that me, from which the pure me can never be dissociated and in which it always receives its own reality. The pure me is always at the same time a psychological me: it can know and act only through the psychological me.

## 53. Absoluteness
**If the subject were not also absolute subject, it would not truly be a subject.**

One may object that the very idea of an absolute subject is contradictory, and it is true in a certain sense that in the notion of the absolute subject—as in the most positive of all correlative terms—the opposition of subject and object is in some manner transcended. This is indeed true, although the absolute is an in-itself to which the name subject is applied as a kind of privilege, since the object is always relative and secondary and has meaning only for the subject and in relation to it. To assert that the subject posits itself as subject only in relation to an object is also true, but the relation is not symmetrical, for the subject needs the object to determine itself, whereas the object needs the subject in order to exist. One may say that the subject is then its own object, but that is merely a manner of speaking transposed illegitimately from knowledge to consciousness. The absolute subject is a subject that is nothing but subject, and from which both the transcendental subject and the psychological subject derive their subjectivity.

## 54. Mediation
**The subject in general mediates between the psychological subject and the absolute subject.**

The subject in general has no independent existence. This explains why philosophy is always tempted to confuse it with the individual subject, turning into psychology, or with the absolute subject, turning into metaphysics. Yet although consciousness constantly strives for an immediate relation between the individual and the absolute, it cannot ignore the existence of a multiplicity of individual subjects. Perhaps one cannot posit even a single subject without positing them all. One must then conceive the relations between each subject and all the others—but to do that one must discover them as subjects, which is possible only through the intermediary of the subject in general, whose incarnation in beings other than myself is easy enough to understand and through which I can conceive how the world in which I live is the very same world in which you live, even though we do not perceive it in the same way.

## 55. Aperspectivity
**The very idea of every centre of perspective on the world must itself be surpassed—and it is surpassed by the idea of an absolute or aperspective subject.**

There is a double reciprocal relation among the three subjects, such that each seems to engender the other, at times as its condition and at times as its effect. That the psychological subject cannot be separated from the transcendental subject is clear enough when one considers that the psychological subject bears within itself the transcendental subject and moves toward it when it rises from the individual to the universal, while the transcendental subject is incarnated in the psychological subject and turns necessarily toward it as soon as it is realized. Likewise the transcendental subject tends toward the absolute subject as toward the very source that feeds it, and the absolute subject tends toward the transcendental subject as toward the condition of the ever-offered participation. The very function of the transcendental subject is to be traversed in such a way that a living and immediate relation can be established between the psychological subject and the absolute subject. Thus the psychological subject rises to the absolute subject in striving to surpass all its limitations, and the absolute subject descends toward the psychological subject as toward actual and personal participation.

## 56. Inseparability
**The three subjects are inseparable and are distinguished only by analysis.**

Despite the distinctions we have drawn, one must not speak of three different subjects placed in hierarchical order and united by some kind of symbiosis. There is only a single subject, within which analysis reveals certain relations that are constitutive of the system of the world. The simplest experience—and a fortiori the most complex—already contains them all. Everything that exists is objective—or rather, everything that exists reveals itself as an object, for nothing has meaning or existence except for the subject.

## 57. Activity
**The subject in general is less a finished subject than a principle that generates the subject.**

If we consider the subject in general as realized, we confuse it with the psychological subject; if we consider it apart from all realization, we confuse it with the absolute subject. The subject in general cannot be either one or the other. It is less a subject than a principle that generates the subject, and it derives this generative power from the absolute subject. The subject in general is an activity that is at once receptive and productive: receptive because it is always receiving from the absolute subject the possibility of being; productive because it must actualize that possibility in an individual subject.

## 58. Level
**The different levels of subjectivity correspond to the different levels of reflection.**

Each level of subjectivity is correlated with a level of reflection. The psychological subject is the subject of the first reflection, the transcendental subject the subject of the second, the absolute subject the subject of the third. Each level of reflection reveals a higher level of subjectivity. Reflection is not a single operation; it is a hierarchy of operations corresponding to a hierarchy of subjects.

## 59. Deepening
**The psychological subject is the only one we experience immediately; the transcendental and the absolute subject are enveloped within it, provided we consent to deepen it.**

I can have no experience other than that of the self that is mine and is therefore always a psychological self—the lived self. It cannot be posited without a thought that thinks it and thereby surpasses it. Such is the character of the transcendental subject, always implied in the psychological subject and inseparable from it. The absolute subject is in turn implied by the transcendental subject, but in such a way that it transcends every act of participation, real or possible. Thus, even though it is present within that act, it is truly absolute subject only insofar as it always remains beyond, beyond us. Furthermore, it has a concrete existence comparable to my own, and like every existence other than mine—even though it sustains and animates mine—it can be posited only through an act of faith.

## 60. Finitude
**The transcendental self belongs not only to humankind but to finite being in general.**

One might be tempted—and people often are—to reduce the transcendental self to the self of humankind as opposed to the self of this or that human being, which is why Kantianism has so often been given a biological interpretation. The memory of Aristotle’s distinction between species and individual is evident here. We hold, however, that the transcendental self is in no way limited to the particular conditions of human existence. It is inseparable from the idea of any perspective whatever that we may have on the world. From this one may conclude that, despite the differences among their perceptions, there is only one world for all finite beings. We may thus deduce conditions that would be, as Kant perceived, the conditions of possibility of experience in general. These conditions must hold beyond humanity, even though they can receive privileged specifications in each particular form of experience: thus there is, without doubt, a space and a time without which no perspective on the world is possible, even though one may distinguish different spaces and times appropriate to the situation and needs of the various beings inhabiting the world. This view might allow us, at least hypothetically, to compare how animals view the world and how we do, in such a way that, although in them there is no break between the psychological self and the transcendental self, they cannot rise from one to the other.

## 61. Continuity
**The psychological self, the transcendental self, and the absolute self reveal themselves only through an uninterrupted deepening, without any of them ever becoming an object.**

The psychological self, the transcendental self, and the absolute self must be regarded as a single self deserving the name consciousness or freedom. There are not three different selves. Participation both links and separates them. One passes from one to another through a progressive deepening, without any one of them ever becoming an object for another. The transcendental self constitutes a kind of mediation between the other two. The distinctive mark of the psychological being is to transcend its own limitation, to orient itself toward the absolute, which is the source of its existence and of all the goods it may possess. But when the orientation is reversed—when we go from the absolute self to the psychological self—we encounter either creation, which is an offered participation, or the fall, should that offer not be accepted, should the creature delight in its own states and refuse to carry out its own spiritual conversion.

## 62. Distinction
**Only the absolute subject allows us to explain the distinction between the psychological subject and the subject in general.**

Without the absolute subject, how could one distinguish between the psychological subject and the transcendental subject? Nothing would prevent one from confounding them. But the psychological subject turns into the transcendental subject as soon as it transcends the horizon of individuality and, positing the absolute of subjectivity, rediscovers within it the foundation of its own existence, of the existence of the other subjects, of their individuality, and at the same time of their agreement.

## 63. Universality
**The absolute subject is universal like the pure subject and concrete like the psychological subject.**

We have seen that the pure subject is realized only within the psychological subject, so that, like abstract entities, it repeats its presence in every individual. It is the same in all because it is the condition of every individual consciousness: it allows them only to resemble one another. That it should itself be possible implies, in fact, that just as the psychological subject refers to it, so it refers in turn to the absolute subject, universal like it, but with a universality that possesses the character of unity and not of repetition, that founds and harmonizes every perspective because it has none, and that is itself as real and concrete as the psychological subject.

## 64. Foundation
**The concrete foundation of the possibility of the pure subject—or, what amounts to the same, of the agreement among individual subjects—cannot lie in a transcendent object but in a subject from which they derive both their activity and their individuality.**

To affirm such a subject is where all the difficulties of philosophy begin. The pure subject is obviously present in the psychological subject, which without it would not in any way be a subject. Yet since the pure subject realizes itself only within the psychological subject, the absolute subject no longer belongs to the sphere of the I or of the me. It is no longer what enables the I or the me to posit itself, but the condition allowing it to posit itself. That condition lies beyond the subject; can we, without paradox, still identify it with a subject, especially once we recognize that it is aperspective? And in calling it a subject, are we not forced, slipping back into idolatry, to identify it either with the individual subject or with a being distinct from that subject, a being that posits the subject as an object through an act of pure creation? Would it not be better to say that the possibility of the pure subject and the agreement among all objects are achieved in the unity of a transcendent object? But such a transcendent object is itself a gratuitous supposition. It is even a contradiction, if it is true that every object exists only for another—that is, is necessarily a phenomenon. Moreover, in attributing unity to it, one makes it clear enough that what one demands of it is precisely what defines the operation proper to the subject considered as realized and not as realizing. Finally one overlooks, both in the activity of the pure subject and in that of the individual subject, that the activity we exercise is itself an activity that is received even as it is exercised.

## 65. Participation
**The absolute subject is a subject in which the psychological subject participates through the intermediary of the pure subject.**

Because the absolute subject is itself without perspectives, it permits and founds them all. It gives each perspective its own interiority, an interiority that is perfect only in the absolute subject. That is why it presents itself to the psychological subject and to the pure subject as a kind of ideal with which they never coincide yet which supports and animates all their movements. The psychological subject is real, but in virtue of its limitation its activity calls for a passivity through which are expressed both its link with the whole of being and the resonance each of its operations has within it. The pure subject is abstract, and although it overcomes the passivity of the sensible, it nonetheless calls, within the idea, for a matter that is merely thought and is imposed on it without its being able either to forget or to reduce it. Thus through their reality the sensible world and the world of ideas attest the participated character of the psychological subject and of the activity of the pure subject, and they point to a pure act—that is, to an absolute subjectivity to which no objectivity corresponds.

## 66. Values
**In correlation with the absolute subject we posit the world of values.**

The absolute subject can appear to the psychological self and to the pure self only as, on the one hand, the principle from which they draw and, on the other, the ideal toward which they tend. Because it is transcendent with respect to the individual subject and to the transcendental subject, which never succeed in equalling it, it obliges them to engage their own development in time and to regard it as a supreme value; and all the functions they may exercise will define particular forms of value by virtue of the relation they maintain with the absolute subject, defined as for them at once the real in which they participate and the ideal toward which they tend.

## 67. Direction
**The world of values does not possess the objectivity of the world of things or even of the world of ideas: instead of filling the interval between the psychological subject and the pure subject as things do, or the interval between the pure subject and the absolute subject as ideas do, it expresses, through the very direction of activity in the subject that posits them, the link between ideas or things and the absolute.**

Values do not constitute a world in the same way as things or ideas do. We cannot apprehend them either in sensible form or in intellectual form. They express the relation of all the terms in the world with the absolute; consequently the things or ideas themselves can be endowed with a character of value. There is no value that does not reverberate in some way on both the plane of things and the plane of ideas. Yet through their immediate relation with the absolute, values can reside only within the subject itself insofar as it participates in that absolute through its own act: this is why value resides in the use the subject makes of things or ideas rather than in things or ideas considered in themselves. This also explains why it cannot be a simple attribute added to being but must be a determination of the subject in relation to being.

## 68. Accord
**The world of ideas and the world of things must agree with one another because they express the two poles of participation.**

The world of things expresses participation on the side of the psychological subject; the world of ideas expresses participation on the side of the pure subject. They must agree because they express two complementary aspects of the same relation with the absolute subject. Things would be meaningless without ideas, ideas empty without things. Their accord is the very condition of the accord among subjects.

## 69. Beyond
**The absolute subject remains beyond every possible participation.**

Even when the subject participates in the absolute, the absolute remains beyond participation. It is not exhausted by any participation; it is always greater than the relations we can establish with it. Participation reveals the absolute to us and yet hides it; it allows us to reach it without ever attaining it. The absolute is the inexhaustible source of participation.

## 70. Ideas
**Ideas respond to participation insofar as they express the forms in which the absolute subject communicates itself to the pure subject.**

Ideas are not mere abstractions; they are the ways in which the absolute communicates itself to the pure subject. They express the forms of participation, the ways in which the subject can resemble the absolute. Hence ideas serve as models both for the world of things and for our actions. They are the forms in which the absolute allows itself to be thought and willed.

## 71. Abundance
**The idea is necessarily both richer and poorer than sensible reality.**

The sensible bears to the idea the same relation as the individual subject bears to the pure subject. The idea always calls for a sensible form, just as the pure subject calls for a psychological form. Thus the sensible seems to add to the idea, as individuality adds to subjectivity as such. And yet we know there is more in the idea: virtualities and possibilities no sensible form will ever succeed in translating, just as there is within sheer subjectivity a richness and fecundity upon which every particular consciousness ceaselessly imposes its own limitation.

## 72. Imagination
**The pure self, by raising me above my individual perspective on the world, allows me to think other particular subjects and, to a certain extent, to imagine them and contain them.**

The pure self is not merely correlated with a world of ideas that offer themselves as objects of inexhaustible intelligence, as sensible objects do for the psychological self. It not only contains the possibility of thinking every idea; it also contains the possibility of becoming every particular subject, not merely through an act of imagination that would lead to an objectification of other subjects, but through a kind of inner realization, within its own consciousness, of all the unused possibilities that allow it—in the only form of knowledge we can apply to others—to become them while still, to a certain extent, remaining itself.

## 73. Reflexivity
**The pure self in turn can become an object for reflection.**

Reflection can also think the pure subject, which is no longer this or that particular subject. There is therefore a power whereby it surpasses the pure subject. One might say that surpassing the pure subject is still an act of the pure subject, which folds its operation back upon itself—just as it was once again the psychological subject that accomplished the operation whereby it became a pure subject while remaining a psychological subject. That is true. Yet this surpassing finds expression only because, just as the individual subject can think itself as individual only by virtue of an act that, though performed by the individual, does not come from it, so the pure subject, when it thinks itself as a finite subject that is not this or that finite subject, as a centre of perspective that is not this or that centre, presupposes within itself an operation that is a limitation of an infinite subjectivity—a taking of perspective within a horizon that renders perspectives possible and includes them all, yet itself includes none.

## 74. Perennity
**The reflective movement has a perennial character; it is always the same and always new.**

Reflection must not be thought to take place once and for all at the beginning of inquiry, after which it would suffice merely to move forward, as if the point of departure were definitively secured. That point of departure is ours to find again at every moment. Every problem we can pose consists in relating an object to an act of the mind that, as it were, discovers within itself the answer to a question it had previously raised. In explaining the real, we go from the given to the operation that explains it—that is, from the answer to the question—instead of proceeding in the opposite order. Science relates particular terms to one another; philosophy relates each term to the unity of the mind and relates them to one another only as a consequence. The reflective movement is therefore constitutive of consciousness; it has a perennial character, always the same, even though in each case it takes on new forms.

## 75. Self
**The absolute subject may be called the “self,” the psychological subject the “me,” and the transcendental subject the “I.”**

It is difficult, as Fichte attempted, to reserve the word “I” for the absolute consciousness, because the “I” resides precisely in the relation among the three modes of consciousness and thus is particularly suitable for the transcendental subject. No doubt when psychological consciousness becomes an object for transcendental consciousness (through an operation that is artificial and illegitimate, for if it were a true object it would cease to be a subject), the psychological subject could be called the “me.” But can I then speak of the “I” of absolute consciousness? I turn it into an object as soon as I notice that I tend toward it without coinciding with it. I may therefore call it a “self,” in order to show that it grounds both the psychological “me” and the transcendental “I.” Yet I must not forget that only because it is a concrete and unique subject, and not a subject in general like the transcendental subject, does it constitute, through the intermediary of the transcendental “I,” the condition of possibility of every particular “me.”

## 75. Self
**Reflection is always reflection upon oneself.**

The task of reflection is to take as its point of departure the object with which the proper act of thought was initially confused. Reflection is the very act by which the subject frees itself from experience. Yet this is only a preliminary operation, for its proper function is to describe the subject while maintaining it as subject—that is, without reducing it to an object. Reflection then brings to light three different aspects of the subject, each implied by the others and inseparable: the individual subject, correlated with the sensible world; the pure subject, which thinks the individual subject and is correlated both with the world of ideas and with the world formed by other subjects; and the absolute subject, which could not posit itself as a centre of perspective, which is correlated with the world of values, and which founds at once the possibility of the indefinite development of every particular subject and their mutual communication.

## 76. Interiority
**Interiority and exteriority do not oppose each other as people often imagine, for interiority is a bundle of relations of exteriority.**

The opposition between inside and outside, each excluding the other, is overly simple and ill describes the relation between consciousness and the world. Consciousness is nothing if it is not consciousness of a world, a world in which it situates us through a whole set of relations it establishes between the world and us. Our apparent interiority is therefore nothing more than that network of exterior relations through which we maintain ourselves within ourselves even while opening ourselves to the world. We are interior only to the extent that we are capable of exteriority.

## 77. Act
**It is legitimate to employ the word act, even though it always evokes an effect, provided we understand that here the effect expresses a limit in which the product of the act is abolished.**

One may wonder whether the word act can be identified with consciousness, for every act seems to imply an effect, so that at the moment it produces that effect, it becomes an object among others. Thus the interiority of our own states might be regarded as an exteriority with respect to pure consciousness. Yet just as consciousness, at the limit, reduces interiority to its own operation, one might say that consciousness, considered at the moment when it is nothing more than the creation of itself and not yet an object it seeks to grasp under that name, is reduced precisely to an act without effect, or to an act whose effect does not differ from the act itself and is abolished within the act insofar as the act is more perfect and more efficacious.

## 78. Naming
**We may apply the word “self” to the absolute subject, the word “me” to the psychological subject, and the word “I” to the transcendental subject.**

It is difficult to reserve the word “I” for absolute consciousness, because the “I” resides precisely in the relation among the three forms of consciousness and for that reason suits the transcendental subject in a privileged way. Certainly one may say that when psychological consciousness becomes an object for transcendental consciousness (by an operation that is artificial and illegitimate, since if it were a true object it would cease to be a subject), the psychological subject could bear the name “me.” But can one then speak of the “I” of absolute consciousness? One also makes of it an object as soon as one notices that one tends toward it without coinciding with it. We can therefore call it a “self,” in order to show that it founds both the psychological “me” and the transcendental “I.” Yet one must not forget that it is only because it is a concrete and unique subject, and not a subject in general like the transcendental subject, that it constitutes, through the intermediary of the transcendental “I,” the condition of possibility of every particular “me.”

## 79. Agent
**The subject is not a pure spectator.**

In defining the subject one usually considers it merely as the subject of representation; and even when it has constructed representation, it ends by being its spectator. Yet the subject is at once spectator and actor, and these two aspects of its nature cannot be dissociated. It is spectator only of that part of the world it has not itself created, even when it constructs the representation of it. Consequently that world is for it only an appearance or an idea; but this very fact—that it is not adequate to the world, which sufficiently explains the necessity yet also the imperfection and incompleteness of knowledge—is the counterweight to the other fact, namely that the subject is itself an agent in the world, helping to create the world by creating itself, yet always surpassed by it. The subject is spectator only because it is also agent, and it is spectator only in order to remain in solidarity with everything in the world that exceeds its own being—that is, its operation.

## 80. Actualization
**Each individual subject actualizes one aspect of the real object.**

The transcendental subject can account only for what, in the representation of the object, is common to all subjects—that is, precisely for its concept. Yet the object is a single, concrete reality bearing within itself an infinity of characteristics. These characteristics, insofar as the object is truly an object—that is, has meaning only for a subject—can be brought out, and even exist, only through an infinity of individual subjects, each of which actualizes one aspect of that indivisible and inexhaustible richness. Thus the existence of even a single particular object requires not merely an individual subject with which it sustains relations defined in the phenomenal world, but all the different subjects whose general condition of possibility the transcendental subject expresses.

## 81. Transcendence
**The subject that judges humanity and gives humanity its meaning stands above humanity.**

When one rises above the psychological subject in order to posit a subject that surpasses it and exists only in the act by which it posits itself, one is tempted to believe that this subject is humankind, even though we have shown that it is finite being in general of which humankind is already a determination. Humankind as such is always an object, not a subject. That is why humankind is not its own end; with respect to the transcendental subject it is what the body is with respect to the psychological subject. For that reason humankind, like the body, must always be surpassed; it is the path of the life of the spirit. It is at once an obstacle and an instrument, a stopping point and a point of departure; we can judge what it is and give meaning to what it may become only through the action of a subject that surpasses it—the transcendental subject—which, in turn, looks toward the absolute subject, just as the psychological subject learned to take the measure of the body to which it was bound, while turning its gaze toward the transcendental subject.

## 82. Indetermination
**The subject in general is also an indeterminate subject; that is why it is related to every possible subject—it is, so to speak, the seat of freedom.**

The subject in general, which is not yet this or that subject, is therefore an indeterminate subject bearing within itself the possibility of every particular subject. One may say that our entire life is nothing more than a choice, at once atemporal and successive, among these different possible subjects. It is through this choice that the being we shall one day be is constituted, and at least within the experience at our disposal it will be completed only on the day of our death. The transcendental subject draws all these possibilities from its own relation with the absolute subject. In it, therefore, are concentrated all the problems inseparable from freedom. Before acting it is nothing; indeed it is nothing but its own operation. Yet that operation determines it, so that it is always midway between a possibility it must isolate in order to actualize it and its very actuality—that is, between indifference and necessity.
