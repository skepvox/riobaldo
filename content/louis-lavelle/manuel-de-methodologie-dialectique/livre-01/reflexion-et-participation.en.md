## 83. Reception
**Reflective activity is our own activity and yet one that we have received.**

*Back to the table of contents*

No activity belongs to us more intimately than reflective activity; it is properly ours, for it is the subject itself insofar as it constitutes itself through a process that depends on it alone. It is freedom detaching itself from what is given and questioning the use it ought to make of itself. And yet this very activity is a power we have received, of which only the use is left to us. In it we discover that character of possibility under which the subject apprehends its own reality, and through which it constitutes both its own being and its representation of the very being of things.

## 84. Deliverance
**Reflection frees us from time: within time it stands where the forward and the return meet, and it is itself the generator of time.**

That reflection stands outside time—not as an act of psychological life but by its meaning and scope—already appears once we realize that it is an interruption of temporal life and puts that life in question precisely in order to examine it and, if need be, to reform it. Thus, even though the steps of reflection are carried out within time, reflection transports us into a world that is independent of time or can make time itself its object. One can show this in another way, by saying that reflection always entails a regression in time that anticipates a progression covering it again, so that it travels the order of time in both directions and consists precisely in the superposition of that going and that returning. In this way it abolishes time, and yet it also engenders it, if in fact there is time only for the one who climbs up or down its course and realizes that this time has two slopes whose ridge reflection occupies.

## 85. Possession
**Consciousness is not the consciousness of nothing: in its very essence it is the taking-possession of the act that makes it exist, just as, as knowledge, it is the taking-possession of an object.**

There is no difficulty in recognizing that knowledge is always the knowledge of an object. But it is consciousness that produces knowledge, so that it would be contradictory to imagine a knowledge of consciousness: that would be to make it an object. Hence the conclusion so often drawn that consciousness is some mysterious being that generates a light it is itself incapable of receiving. Yet this is not altogether true. Consciousness illuminates, in its pure exercise, that activity by which it creates itself, without however making it into an object distinct from itself to which it might apply. (The difference between the knowledge of an object and the consciousness of our activity may be expressed in the following formula: the object reveals itself to us by its opacity, and the activity by its transparency to light.) Now theories of consciousness either reduce it to an activity that, almost without realizing it, produces all the objects of knowledge, or to the knowledge we have of those objects, without inquiring into the activity that apprehends them. In the first case we are dealing with a transcendental idealism, in the second with an empirical idealism. But they must be united by establishing between the constitutive activity of consciousness and the consciousness that illuminates that activity a kind of circle such that the activity is nothing except by the very consciousness that brings it into play, and consciousness nothing except through the revelation of the activity that makes it be. And if consciousness is always inseparable from the knowledge of some object, it remains present in that knowledge with the traits we have just attributed to it, and it is the very function of reflection to discover them.

## 86. Found Absolute
**Reflective regression proceeds in principle ad infinitum, yet from its very first step it already gives us the absolute it seeks.**

Clearly reflective regression can be pursued indefinitely, and when we have posited thought we can posit the thought of thought, which might lead us to believe that we have entered a process in which we shall never reach the first term sought. But we already have that first term as soon as we posit the thought of thought—that is, thought insofar as it is conscious of itself. We never climb higher. The thought of thought is homogeneous with thought itself, just like all the successive thoughts that could be obtained by some new doubling. If the condition of thought is itself a thought, the discovery of thought reveals to us at once its own genesis.

## 87. Artifice
**It is only by a verbal artifice that one can use the expression “thought of thought” and then embark on an infinite regress: thought cannot make itself into an object.**

In reality, when we employ the expression “thought of thought,” we convert thought into an object and imagine that it can know itself in the same way as it knows an object different from itself. Then of the thought that thinks it one can say that it can become the object of yet another thought, and so forth. But that is merely an artifice. To convert thought into an object is to reify it, to ruin it as thought. If, therefore, under penalty of annihilating itself, thought must, at the very moment when it seems to double back to seize itself, remain an act both in the aspect whereby it knows and in the aspect whereby it is known, this simply shows that this act is its own light. The most original feature of consciousness is thus revealed: it is an operation whereby the self creates itself, without our being able to distinguish here between cause and effect, between apprehension and what it apprehends. In knowledge, the duality of object and subject is the very condition of their unity; in consciousness, it is unity that doubles itself without ever changing into duality. Such is the true sense of the reflexive verb, which alone can express the primitive act of thought and which alone allows this act to be an act of thought. Otherwise that act would be an act without consciousness; and how would consciousness be born from the presence of the object, when I can know that object only because the very act that produces it bears within itself this consciousness that is always consciousness of self, and without which knowledge itself would remain foreign to consciousness? One must therefore maintain an absolute identity between the thought that thinks itself and the thought it thinks. A thought that did not think itself would not be a thought; but it does not think itself as an object, even though it always thinks an object. The expression “thought of thought” shows that one cannot go back beyond thought, which is the first beginning of itself just as it is the first beginning of all things; the thought of thought is less the consciousness of thought than thought considered in its generating act.

## 88. First Term
**The very task of reflective regression is to stop at the first term instead of embarking on an infinite process, for this first term is no longer a particular term but an activity presupposed by all others and found identical with itself as soon as it doubles itself.**

It is only in appearance that reflective regression launches into an endless process in order then to become the reflection of reflection, and so on. We do not pass from a particular thought to another particular thought that would be the thought of the first; we pass from a given object of thought to the possible thought of that object, which at the same time is the possible thought of every object. It is therefore not only similar to itself whatever the object to which it is applied, but also at each of the steps of the regression. This clearly means that from the very first step what we grasp is this pure power of thinking considered in all its generality, with no need for us to go any farther.

## 89. Omnipresence
**Reflection brings us face to face with an omnipresent activity, which we can nonetheless always re-engage in time.**

Reflection does not merely bring us face to face with an activity that remains the same whatever operation it may accomplish: in truth what reflection discovers is its omnipresence. It is therefore regressive only in appearance. It is always at our disposal in the same fashion and with the same ever-indeterminate power. It is up to us to seize it in order to put it to work. But this is possible only on condition that each time we insert it into time by an operation that is itself a moment of our life and can always be begun anew. In each movement of our consciousness we thus test the link between the temporal and the eternal.

## 90. Creativity
**Reflection is not only the act by which I detach myself from the world; it is also the act by which I recover a creative activity that makes me participate in it.**

It may seem that reflection, by which an intellectual world independent of the given world is constituted, is itself sterile and presupposes that world without penetrating it. But this is untrue. Reflection is itself a real activity; it forms part of the real, which is not the same before and after reflection has been exercised, even when reflection does not turn into a decision of the will. This activity by which reflection constitutes itself is the very same activity by which all things are made: it borrows from it the power it possesses. By a movement that is our own, reflection makes us participate in it, enabling us to give our subjective being an independent existence and, at the same time, allow it to remain homogeneous with the whole created world by virtually re-creating it within us.

## 91. Solidarity
**Reflection inscribes me in a whole of subjectivity in which my own self stands in solidarity with every other self, dwelling with them above the world even though it finds its expression with them in the world.**

Reflection transports us into a world that is not the world before my eyes, even though it stands in relation with it. It is a subjective world where I find only operations of thought and the ideas that correspond to them, and I know that they constitute a domain of possibilities that infinitely exceeds anything I shall ever actualize. Thus the subjective world into which reflection lets me enter extends far beyond the confines of my own self. To discover another self is to discover that it enters there with me, and that this world is consequently common to all selves. All real and possible selves together are barely enough to take possession of it; that is why they play the role of mediators for one another. Yet although this subjective world rises above the world before our eyes and although I ceaselessly climb from the latter to the former, the former is necessary to the latter to provide not only a point of support but also those modes of expression without which the revelation we have of it could be neither confirmed nor communicated.

## 92. Pure Detachment
**In the purity of the “I,” representations detach themselves from the intellectual act just as tendencies detach themselves from the act of the will.**

The “I” must not be confused with the sum of representations: it is the act without which they would not exist, yet it detaches itself from them, becomes independent of them, contains their possibility, and exercises jurisdiction over them as our consciousness becomes purer and, so to speak, folds back upon the very source of all its thoughts—upon the activity that sustains them, governs them, and judges them, yet refuses to be absorbed by any of them. Likewise, when we consider our conduct, it is determined by our tendencies, but those tendencies are the matter of my action rather than its principle. When I undergo them or yield to them, it is my very self that abdicates. Once, however, it affirms itself, my will appears; it becomes independent of the tendencies just as the intellectual act was of its representations, and, like it, it cannot dispense with a support, yet it never remains bound to it.

## 93. Conditions
**In doubt I do not abolish things, nor even bracket them: they must be there if I am to rise to their conditions of possibility.**

One cannot conceive the subject as separate from its operation, nor this operation as separate from the object to which it is applied. If reflection wins itself through doubt directed at things, it does not abolish those things, nor does it even bracket them. They must remain there if I am to rise to their conditions of possibility. In those conditions what I discover is the possibility of all things—that is, those operations that it is precisely mine to accomplish and that prove their validity in their very encounter with things. Those operations were already implied in the presence through which things were given to me: the role of reflection is merely to enable me to become conscious of them.

## 94. Possibility
**Conditions of possibility presuppose a freedom that discovers them and confronts them with their object; sometimes they are realized with, sometimes without, the concurrence of the will: in the latter case, were we able to enumerate them all, they would confer necessity on the object.**

These conditions of possibility make sense only through a freedom that is exercised in two stages: first in their search, when it separates itself from what is given in order to discover them, and then in their implementation, when it returns to what is given in order to relate it to them. I thus obtain a kind of encounter between the virtual and the actual, which gives the real the intelligibility proper to it. Two cases must be distinguished. When it is the subject that effects the passage from virtuality to actuality, it acts as will; but when it acts only as intelligence—that is, when it goes no farther than the possibility of the object that has actualized itself without it—then the enumeration of all its conditions of possibility, were it feasible, would transform the object’s mere existence into necessity.

## 95. Creative Play
**Critical reflection, by turning back on itself, discovers creative activity in its own play.**

One might think that because reflection always presupposes some given to which it applies, it is essentially a critical reflection that asks the given for its credentials, sorts it out, and constantly turns fact into right. But there is also a reflection on reflection itself, or a critique of the critique, and although it may be said to constitute a kind of circle, the advantage of that circle is that it keeps us within reflection so as to make us discover in it, as both the condition and the means of liberating its properly critical activity, a properly creative activity that is nothing other than the spirit in action apprehended in its own efficacy, inasmuch as it expresses not merely the reason for being but the productivity of the reason for being.

## 96. Intermediate
**The reflective act stands between the created object and the creative act.**

Consciousness can be defined only as the consciousness of an object. And if one wished to make it the consciousness of consciousness, it would have to be, at least in its initial exercise, already the consciousness of an object; otherwise it would remain a mere virtuality. Thus consciousness presupposes creation and constitutes a kind of subjective doubling of it. But as soon as reflection has taken place, it isolates, as it were, that representative movement by which the object seems to become the work of thought itself. This is a participation in the creative activity, which, incapable of giving itself the reality of the world, makes it present to itself by representation before modifying it within the very limits assigned to its power. Reflection is therefore the path that allows us to connect the created object with the creative act.

## 97. Lack
**The existence of the sensible or of the idea is an effect of participation, expressing both what it lacks and what fulfils it.**

Participation itself is always an act, but an act that is fulfilled only in the absolute subject and not in the transcendental or in the psychological subject. Neither of these two subjects can be separated from the absolute subject; they must both be correlated with a given that expresses what they lack in order to coincide with the absolute subject, yet at the same time a presence that the absolute subject brings them and without which each would remain a form without content. The sensible is what the psychological subject lacks so as to join the transcendental subject, and the idea is what the transcendental subject lacks so as to join the absolute subject: this suffices to explain the agreement between the sensible and the idea.

## 98. Existence
**Only the individual subject and the absolute subject truly exist; the transcendental subject expresses the very condition that makes the latter present within the former.**

The psychological subject and the absolute subject both have concrete existence; and the psychological subject, incapable of sufficing for itself, derives its existence from the absolute subject, which is perfect existence—just as the body, in the static language of representation, is bound to space and derives from it its very nature as body: its limitation and its passivity likewise presuppose in the body an infinity and an activity that sustain them and make sense only for them. But the transcendental subject is the instrument of participation; for that reason we cannot attribute true existence to it. It draws from the absolute subject the efficacy by which it becomes itself a subject, yet not this or that subject, whose limits are not yet defined but must be, who possesses a power not yet determined but that demands being.
