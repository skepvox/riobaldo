## 21. Circularity
**Philosophy begins and ends with the act of reflection.**

The act of reflection is not a first act. The very name we give it presupposes a reality from which it separates itself in order to let us understand it. Yet we know nothing of that reality except through the very act that detaches us from it. Hence we cannot posit that reality prior to the reflection that makes it appear in the operation through which it applies itself to it and already surpasses it. There is no reflection without an object, but there is an object only for reflection. And philosophy culminates in the act of reflection: there is no reality that reflection could reveal to us and within which it would one day dissolve, thereby consummating, along with its own ruin, the ruin of philosophy itself. Such an ambition would be contradictory, since a reality that reflection discovers exists only for it and disappears along with it. This suffices to explain why reflection, whose role is to show us the real, is held to be incapable of creating it, even though in adding itself to the real it adds something to it, and in producing it into the light it seems to produce it.

## 22. Originary Character
**Reflection is an originary operation that itself has no origin.**

It is impossible to assign reflection an origin; it would fall to reflection itself to undertake that task. Reflection is the first beginning of every explanation and of the explanation of itself. One can only describe it—and even then it is reflection that describes itself. This proves that it is consciousness grasping itself in its pure exercise, not, as is often said, by taking its own act as an object, but by considering that act in its relation to any object whatsoever. One may propose a psychological or historical origin for reflection: one will then say that it presupposes, as its name indicates, an obstacle against which tendency collides and which awakens in us the representation of the object and the problem it poses. But how are we to speak of tendency and obstacle otherwise than by means of reflection, which is already analyzing itself? Taken in itself, reflection is a gratuitous initiative; yet as soon as it acts, it makes the conditions of its action appear, as well as the world that sustains it and to which it is opposed. To posit first such a world out of which one would claim to make it emerge is to invert the true order.

## 23. Affirmation
**Reflection cannot be confused with negation.**

Linking reflection with the obstacle leads one to think that reflection is a negative procedure. The obstacle denies the tendency and forces it to flow back upon itself by engendering reflection. But it is reflection that discovers the tendency and affirms it instead of denying it, while refusing to be confused with it and by examining it—that is, by continually surpassing it. The same is true of the world as it presents itself to us in a first experience: to reflect is not to deny it; it is first to become aware that it is posited and consequently to posit it. Reflection is much less a suspended affirmation than an available, exacting affirmation that strives to fortify itself without end. That is what is meant in saying that it is the negativity of negation, that is, that it abolishes what is limited in any affirmation, yet in that affirmation nonetheless posits what is affirmed in it. In doubt it experiences, not (as Descartes led people to believe) liberty, but its restraints. It does not even bracket the world, for the world is still there—even if only as the problem it raises within itself.

## 24. Fruitfulness
**Reflection is neither sterile nor self-sufficient.**

It is wrongly regarded as sterile because one supposes that all reality precedes it and that, when it separates itself from that reality, it can do no more than duplicate it. Yet apart from the fact that this doubling is consciousness itself, it is evident that it is through reflection that reality appears as such. Thus, if reflection separates itself from the real, it is in order to make the real into the very object to which it applies. But then, must one not conclude that the real is the effect of its operation and that it is reflection that constructs it? Reality has indeed been viewed at times as prior to the reflective act and at other times as posterior to that act. If so, reflection ought to be able to suffice to itself. That, however, is not true either, for although the real is revealed only to reflection, reflection posits it precisely as an object it discovers, not as an object it creates: reflective activity posits itself as non-creative. In that discovery it does not claim either to exhaust the object or to be adequate to it, even though it alone can comprehend it.

## 25. Nature
**Reflection presupposes nature, yet first discovers and defines it.**

When we speak of reflection, we think we are dealing with the most spiritual operation of the mind. Yet reflection presupposes nature and seems to suppose it in such a way that nature is prior to it, sustains it, and is not sustained by it. Reflection defines the subject in opposition to nature, and the subject only exists by distinguishing itself from nature. Hence reflection seems to depend on nature and to find in nature the material to which it applies. But we must not forget that reflection is what first reveals nature to us, first distinguishes it, first defines it. Nature is the first object that reflection contemplates, the first thing to which it applies itself; it is what gives reflection its very name. If reflection discovers nature, it is because nature is both what reflection seizes and what it yields up. Reflection therefore presupposes nature and discovers it, yet only because nature reveals itself to reflection and is nothing without it.

## 26. Constitution
**Reflection constitutes the me in relation to the world and in relation to itself.**

If reflection reveals nature, it also constitutes the me. It is the me insofar as the me distinguishes itself from the world and recognizes itself as distinct. It is the me insofar as the me takes possession of itself and of the world. Reflection therefore constitutes the me in the same way that it constitutes nature. It is what establishes a relation between the me and nature, between the me and itself. It is the me insofar as the me is conscious of itself, and it is consciousness insofar as it is the consciousness of the me. Without reflection there would be neither me nor nature nor world. Reflection is what constitutes them and unites them while distinguishing them.

## 27. Privilege
**The me is an object for reflection, yet a privileged object—the only one it can hope to resolve into its own operation.**

The me remains, however, the privileged object of reflection, and here for the first time we encounter the circle that is characteristic of every venture of reflection. We can say both that it is the me that reflects and that reflection takes the me as its object. In this relation of reflection with the me lies the very core of the problem of reflection—and doubtless of the problem of Being as well. Here reflection reveals its profoundest essence. It is often thought that there is reflection only of the me on the me, or that reflection is simply the me reflecting—or, more exactly, reflecting itself. What we examine here is a total reflection, in which the entire universe offers itself to be understood. But the knot of reflection resides in its relation with the me and with the world the me inhabits: for while the world, from which reflection detaches itself, tends in the same operation to detach itself from reflection, the same is not true of the me. The me first appears as nature, but as reflection progresses the me abandons itself as nature in order to ally itself ever more closely with the act of reflection.

## 28. Transtemporality
**Just as reflection separates us from the object to which it applies, it separates us from the time in which it is nonetheless exercised.**

Considered through its application, reflection is said to have an object; considered in its exercise, it is itself a temporal operation. Yet it separates itself from time just as it separates itself from the object. Because it applies itself to the object in general—that is, to any possible object—it also thinks time in general, and not merely the particular time in which it is exercised. It leaves time its proper character of being not an object but the dimension of movement and life. And because reflection is subjective even while always bound to the object, we shall also say that it is atemporal even while always bound to time; better still, we might name it transtemporal.

## 29. Inversion
**The act of reflection is called inversion when viewed in its intellectual aspect and conversion when viewed in its volitional aspect.**

In time, the original character of reflection manifests itself in a new form. For insofar as it is atemporal, it expresses within time, so to speak, the point of view of eternity. But insofar as it is exercised in time, it ceases to be subject to time—that is, to undergo its course. It is therefore always marked by an interruption or a reprise. This is a kind of reversal of time, in which reflection, ceaselessly calling into question all that is, attends not to what proceeds but to that from which it proceeds. Now insofar as reflection applies itself to an object—that is, insofar as it is intelligence—it is an inversion of the real: it goes from effect to cause, and not from cause to effect; it is the manifestation of the cause. Insofar as reflection distinguishes itself from spontaneity yet remains bound to it—that is, insofar as it is will—it ceases to obey the pressure of desire, wresting desire away from nature and seeking behind it the value it presupposes but that only reflection can posit: it is a conversion.

## 30. Regression
**Reflection is always regressive.**

The words inversion and conversion mark as clearly as reflection itself that action of return, that questioning of nature or of the object that obliges us to climb from the conditioned to the condition, in such a way that this movement seems never to be stopped. For the condition becomes a new point of application for reflection, which is why reflection is almost always reproached for impotence. But this would be true only if the condition were homogeneous with the conditioned. Although this regression can begin again endlessly, it does not consist in running backward through all the terms of a series that itself would have no end. Rather, this infinitude is a sign of the fecundity of the reflective act, which is wholly present in its first movement. What it reveals is the subject, which, in positing itself, posits everything that can be posited. Reflection, a folding back upon the subject, therefore delivers into our hands—in the subject itself, which never ceases to deepen—the origin and the foundation of all that is.

## 31. Surpassing
**By tracing time backward reflection overcomes time.**

This regression, which seems to take place in time, is intended only to allow us to escape time. For, on the one hand, the very function of regression is to annihilate progression at the moment it is about to cover it. The order of intelligence and the order of action are inverse to each other, yet identical: one expresses in the language of phenomenon what the other expresses in the language of idea. The discovery of the idea through reflection is itself a progress in a new time—that of thought—while by comparison the time of action might be considered a regression. The superposition of these two times obliges us not to abolish time but to go beyond it. On the other hand, we might say that this regression in time is a kind of refusal of time; we try to extricate ourselves from it. Reflection makes us leave time while still remaining bound to it, so that it may account, through the atemporal, for everything temporal.

## 32. Inscription
**Reflection ceaselessly separates itself from every object to which it applies, yet not from the totality of being in which it is inscribed.**

At the moment when reflection accomplishes the very act by which it constitutes itself by separating itself from the real, it introduces into the totality of being a being that is its own. One may oppose it to the real by reserving the name real for what is given, since reflection exists only in the act that makes it be. In this sense one may say it is unreal. Yet it is not foreign to being itself: it is not enough to say that between being and nothing there is nothing; nothingness is nothing. There is therefore a being of reflection whose properties must be determined among all the aspects of being. Indeed, it is the very function of reflection to make this distinction, to determine the original character of each aspect, to fix among them its own place. The mind naturally tends to think that the first being resides at the point where reflection is exercised and that every other mode of being derives from reflection and has meaning only in relation to it. Nonetheless one cannot doubt that reflection is not itself an absolute first beginning; when it acts, it discovers its solidarity with the other modes of being on which it depends, just as they depend on it.

## 33. Possibility
**The indivisibility of being, which makes it for reflection an infinity of possibility it strives to actualize, makes that infinite possibility the very being of reflection.**

Being is indivisible, and reflection does not separate itself from it in order to think it: it inscribes itself in it rather than detaching itself from it. Yet its original feature is precisely to encompass within itself, in a certain manner, the totality of being in whose interior it is nonetheless taken. It does not contain being, but it applies itself to it. Even before being its real object, being is its possible object. Its proper function is to transform every real object into a possible object, even though the possibility it posits far exceeds the objectivity it reaches. It moves entirely along this double path that goes from the real to the possible and from the possible to the real. Its twofold task is to seek the possibility of each thing and to actualize that possibility. This is not a vain task if, as proposition XXXIV will show, it is thereby that the self succeeds in introducing itself into the world by cooperating with the creative action. This possibility of the whole is a form of being opposed to given being, yet defined only in relation to it: reflection itself is defined as the possibility of being.

## 34. Generation
**Reflection transforms the real into the possible and the possible into the real; it moves in contrary directions according as we go from the real to the possible or from the possible to the real.**

This double conversion of the real into the possible and of the possible into the real would appear absolutely sterile were it not precisely what allows the self to found both its independence and its own existence. The self is coextensive with indivisible Being, yet it separates itself from Being in such a way that, under the name understanding, it relates to Being without being it, forming its spectacle—that is, its representation or its knowledge—while refusing to remain a mere spectator, and so that, under the name will, it assumes Being itself insofar as Being is the origin of itself and of everything that depends on itself. The opposition and connection of understanding and will establish within Being a distinction between the Being I know, which is always outside me, and the Being I give myself through my own operation, the Being that I am—without prejudice to the interaction between these two functions, which prevents the unity of Being from ever being broken.

## 35. Questioning
**Reflection is an absolute questioning, yet one that always awaits from experience some new answer.**

One would fail to understand how reflection could be defined as a regression if it were not first a questioning. It has often been shown that the very function of reflection is to put the real in question; that is why reflection separates itself from the real, yet without really separating from it, since the real remains there as the very problem to be solved. Reflection converts the real into a problem. But this means that it turns from the real to its condition of possibility. Hence the reason why time, at least in the movement that returns from the present to the past, is in some sense the means invented by reflection in order to pursue itself. Nevertheless, if reflection has meaning only because it is a questioning, it also requires an answer, and it cannot supply that answer itself. Experience alone can do so. Reflection solicits and prepares an experience destined to answer all the problems it raises.

## 36. Affirmation of the Self
**The self of refusal has meaning only through the self of affirmation.**

It is often thought that the self constitutes itself through a movement of separation or refusal in which, ceasing to be absorbed by the universe, it denies that universe in order to institute within that denial its independent existence. Thus one often interprets the Cartesian doubt, on which people dwell with complacency when they equate it with a refusal and see in it the mark of a freedom and spirituality unwilling to be enslaved. One even fears that this “no” might one day be transformed into a “yes,” as though in that transformation, by committing itself anew, the self would once again alienate itself and submit to the yoke. It is hard to tell whether there is more illusion or vanity in this attitude. For the self separates itself only in appearance from the world whose law it undergoes in exercising the very power by which it imagines that it refuses that law. Negation itself has meaning only as the condition of an affirmation that gives us more satisfaction than that which negation repels; furthermore, that negation is itself an indeterminate affirmation, better than all others because of its universality, and it must try to find itself again in particular affirmations instead of excluding them.

## 37. Reduplication
**Reflection is a kind of reduplication that, without ever making itself an object, encloses itself in a circle showing how it is a first beginning.**

The very word reflection characterizes the need for a datum that serves it as point of departure and for a reduplication through which, after having questioned that datum, it tries to recreate it by an operation it accomplishes. But this reduplication is not sterile. There is no identity between the object that served as the matter for reflection and the object reflection rediscovers, even though reflection insists that there be an encounter between them showing how they agree. Yet that agreement is not a coincidence, except insofar as the objective appearance acquires a certain transparency with respect to its subjective essence. Still, one must not content oneself, as people often do, with saying that reflection produces a new object that can in turn become the matter of a second reflection, and that this progress can go on forever. Pursued to infinity, this movement of regression, instead of sending us in quest of some first term that could explain the rest, reveals the presence, in each of its movements, of an act of the mind that is an omnipresent first term beyond which one does not go. Thus one could say that reflection creates a kind of circle in which it attests the impossibility either of breaking out of it or of retracing it entirely, or that it sets in motion an open spiral whose direction and scope it regulates.

## 38. Circle
**Reflection is circular, yet the circle it forms is one whose centre is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere.**

In reflection the mind always seems to return to the point it left, yet that point is no longer the same, for there is nothing in the universe that reflection cannot illuminate. Reflection therefore forms a circle, yet a circle whose centre is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere. The mind never comes back to exactly the same point; reflection is an endless beginning. Because the circle is everywhere, it can always widen; because its circumference is nowhere, it never closes.

## 39. Beginning
**Reflection is the first beginning of every experience, yet within experience any term can serve as a beginning.**

Reflection is the first beginning of every experience, or rather the act through which every experience is suspended from a first beginning that one may say begins forever, or that is forever at our disposal. This means that every first beginning resides in an act of thought, or that the act of thought itself is independent of time. Conversely, if we consider the content of experience itself, it is always given to our consciousness as the starting point of reflection. Within that experience there is a privileged term: any term situated at any place or any time can serve equally as a first term for reflection, because it is impossible to posit it without positing the whole of experience. What we adopt as the origin of reflection is less this or that particular experience than the possibility of all experience, which in a sense justifies the method adopted by Kant.

## 40. Subjective Being
**The word being can be taken only in a subjective sense: what belongs to being is what exists in itself and has relation to itself.**

It is evident that the word being encompasses, in its extension, both subjectivity and objectivity; yet one cannot overlook that it is within being that subjectivity and objectivity are distinguished and opposed. Moreover, one cannot ignore that these two terms, despite the relation uniting them, cannot be situated on the same plane. Subjectivity possesses an undeniable privilege: it is defined as what exists in itself and for itself, even if it reveals itself to itself only in contrast with an exteriority it pushes, so to speak, outside itself. This is the only way it can define itself, less in its essence than in its finitude. But then exteriority is what exists only for the me and in its relation to the me; otherwise it would itself be an interiority. It is that relation with the me that constitutes its essence as exteriority, which amounts to saying that exteriority as such has no essence. Accordingly, even if objectivity and subjectivity cannot be isolated from one another, in their very relation subjectivity shows its logical and ontological priority: exteriority presupposes and limits subjectivity instead of being equal and correlative to it.

## 41. Discovery
**Reflection is the discovery of the subjectivity of Being.**

When reflection begins, it always manifests itself as a separation from the object and as a questioning of that object. But what is this being that puts every object in question and is not itself an object? We are compelled to say that it is a subject, that is, a being wholly interior to itself, or that gives itself being through an act it alone can accomplish. Before performing that act, it it was not a subject, though it could be an object for another subject. But by discovering itself as subject it discovers that all objects have meaning and existence only for it and in relation to it. Consequently it grasps Being in itself only in the form of subjectivity, which is the origin of the very objectivity that has meaning only through its relation to subjectivity and which derives from subjectivity the very possibility it has of being posited as an object. Thus reflection enables us to discover not only the subjectivity of Being but, within that very subjectivity, the origin of all objectivity.
