## 1. Intellectual Insight

Dialectical methodology is an effort to penetrate the real by means of operations of the intellect. In disciplining the intellect it does not reduce the whole of the real to it. Intelligence is precisely the faculty that recognises the heterogeneity—both with respect to itself and among themselves—of all the objects to which it applies. Alone it has the plasticity and suppleness needed to represent, with their distinctive features, the infinity of modes of the real. It must for that purpose remain neutral. Its rôle is to describe the originality of each mode, to show their articulations, to allow us to discern their essence and to determine their meaning in relation to the others. Since its unity envelops a diversity of operations and of correlated objects, intelligence regulates the play of these operations by a method and displays, through a dialectic, the relations of these operations with every object to which they apply.

## 2. Integral Theory

Dialectical methodology appears purely theoretical, yet it is also a theory of sensibility and of will, which would be nothing for consciousness were they not taken up into its light without being abolished. That is why it founds taste in the domain of sensibility and wisdom in the domain of conduct. It respects the originality of sensible quality as well as that of individual subjects. It reduces neither quality to concepts nor individuality to ideas. Its mission is to show the place occupied in the world by quality as quality and by the self—or by another self—insofar as it can be posited in its independence and irreducibility.

## 3. Regressive Movement

The method takes its origin in the regressive movement whereby reflection, questioning everything that is, brings us back to the subject and distinguishes within the subject itself the relation among its psychological, transcendental, and absolute forms. The transcendental subject stands between the other two. There is, however, only one subject and not three subjects: the transcendental proceeds from the absolute subject and incarnates itself in the psychological subject. The interval separating it from the absolute subject is filled by the world of ideas, just as the interval separating it from the psychological subject is filled by the sensible world. Between these two worlds a regulated correspondence holds. They are merely the means of communication among psychological subjects which, through the same transcendental subject, participate in the same absolute subject. Psychological subjects can become independent, and nevertheless enter into relation with one another, only thanks to space and time, which give each a body of its own and hence an individual intimacy and a becoming that are unique and ineffable. The spatiotemporal world, while enclosing them within themselves, is nonetheless common to all; it supplies the signs by which they express both what distinguishes them and what they share, and, in a certain manner, what is identical within their very differences. For by turning toward the transcendental subject—which is nothing more than the subject in general—they submit to the common laws of participation. They then rise to the world of ideas. For them ideas are still objects of contemplation; they do not allow their individual existence to be abolished in them, but they require that existence to be grounded. This is possible only if ideas, instead of abolishing the sensible world, themselves found it by becoming values through which, by way of the transcendental subject, the psychological subject joins the absolute subject and assumes, in relation to it, the vocation of giving meaning both to itself and to the world.

## 4. Constitution of the Self

The self is constituted in the relation between the psychological, the transcendental, and the absolute subject. It can be constituted only through a free act—an act that is the participation of the absolute subject, from which it draws the initiative that makes it the first beginning of itself, yet obliges it, in order to be, to determine itself, that is, to incarnate itself in the psychological subject. That is why freedom is not situated at the level of the psychological self, which, considered on its own—as psychologists and caractérologists naturally do—seems subject to deterministic laws. The self is constantly in question, and freedom is always above it. Freedom is as indeterminate as the transcendental subject; its power to give itself being incessantly takes up the psychological self anew without ever becoming solidary with it, even though it cannot dispense with it—so that the psychological self supplies the very conditions without which freedom would remain pure virtuality and through which it must be realised. Those conditions were not chosen by freedom; had it chosen them it would not be limited by them and would not be distinguished from pure act. They are the general conditions inseparable from the spatiotemporal order that allows every freedom to act while remaining distinct from all others and without breaking the unity of the world.

## 5. Suspended Freedom

At the level of the transcendental subject the freedom of the self is suspended between the absolute subject and the psychological subject, unable to identify itself with either. It is, in truth, our own possibility. The self consists in the existence of a possibility. Yet that possibility can be actualised only if the self converts the whole of the real into a possibility whose actualisation will allow it to actualise itself. Hence the scission of its activity into an intellectual activity that converts the real into the possible and into a voluntary activity that converts the possible into the real. This conversion brings us closer to the source of every possibility: we seek within each possible not merely its relation to the object it explains but the relation to the absolute that justifies it—that is, we transform it into value. It is then that it engages our will and makes us cooperate indivisibly in the creation of ourselves and of the world.

## 6. Supra-intentional Consciousness

We thus rise to a supra-intentional consciousness that must not be taken as inoperative because it would be in a state of pure disinterestedness. Such disinterestedness is the very activity of the mind, being born from itself and consummating itself within itself, pursuing its own play at the level of participation through a cycle of operations and data. This apparently contemplative attitude cannot be reproached with remaining separate from the world or deaf to other beings, to the demands of action or to the claims of sensibility and will, for it is attention alone that can discern them and give them their value and meaning. Every philosophy resides in a certain perfection of attention. Such is the true intellectualism which, far from abolishing the concrete reality in which life is engaged, fills it with light and gives us a plenary possession of it, restoring both its essence and its savour.

## 7. Mutual Transcendence

All beings transcend one another. Each must be regarded as a freedom exercised through the assumption of a possibility. Such an act has, by its nature, nothing general or common; it is personal and secret. For every other being it is as transcendent as God Himself—and as our own freedom is transcendent to the experience we or others can have of us. This transcendence is the same one that obtains between the thing and perception, between the past and memory. One might conclude that the perceived thing or the remembered thing is nothing more than a spiritual act to which I remain inadequate and which I vainly attempt to equal. The perceived thing corresponds to an act that does not come from me and which I can imagine from the outside only through the modifications I impose upon it, from the inside only through the dynamic surge that unfolds its appearance before me. The remembered event corresponds to the very act of perception together with the content to which it once applied; it is this that I strive to evoke, and here the comparison between thought and its object becomes easier. Yet the object always remains beyond the act by which I grasp it. One might say that the transcendent is always the object of faith rather than of knowledge, but that would be insufficient. For transcendence is posited in its relation to me; the operation I accomplish has meaning only because it implies and refers to it. The transcendental subject carries within itself possibilities in which I discover those I have not actualised and which another has chosen. Such is the rôle of imagination: I imagine within me, or beyond me, another self that might have been me, that to a certain extent is me, and with which I formed, even before discovering it, a kind of ideal society. The passage from possible to real—whether within me or outside me—creates among all beings capable of saying “I” a complicity and even a fraternity.
