## 1. Meaning
**Philosophical discovery bears upon the meaning of the world and of life.**

The aim of philosophical discovery is not to reveal new objects of knowledge, nor—as the positivists believed—to achieve a systematisation of all acquired knowledge. We know well that no particular item of knowledge and no accumulation of knowledge can take the place of genuine philosophy. The widest learning may coexist with philosophical despair; the unlearned person is not necessarily bereft of philosophical light. The only difference between the philosopher and the non-philosopher is that the former knows, or at least seeks, the meaning of the world and of life, whereas the latter ignores it or remains indifferent to it. Paradoxically, it may suffice for the philosopher to know what meaning itself is—that is, the meaning of meaning—in order to discover it in the real and realise it in life.

## 2. Play
**We are caught up in the play of the meaning of the world and of life, which cannot differ from the meaning we give them.**

The world cannot possess a meaning apart from the meaning we give it. Meaning is a thought, and the world cannot have thought independently of the thinking subject. Perhaps it is impossible to conceive of a world devoid of every reference to a subject, but it is certain that outside such reference the world would be meaningless. There is the closest solidarity between the very existence of the world as spectacle and the meaning we attribute to it. It would be illusory to suppose that the world as pure spectacle can be isolated from the meaning consciousness bestows upon it, for the world exists as spectacle only in order to carry that meaning. The relation between spectacle and meaning must ultimately be grounded in the distinction we draw between the primary functions of consciousness, which oblige us to represent the world so that we may be capable of willing it.

## 3. Recognition
**We ourselves are part of the play, and we cannot give things an arbitrary meaning: we recognise meaning, yet we cannot recognise it without consenting to it.**

We cannot regard ourselves as separate from the world, as if it possessed meaning only for us. The meaning we give the world is not arbitrary. However much we try to detach ourselves from the world, we are also engaged in it; the world constitutes itself only as bearer of meaning. Meaning must therefore be discovered rather than imposed; it surpasses individual subjectivity. It resides, no doubt, in the discovery of a subjective universality in which individual subjectivity participates and of which the world is the instrument. Meaning transcends individual will, which submits to it rather than dictating it. Because we are ourselves part of the play, we must consider meaning as something to be recognised—a revelation made to us. Yet the solidarity among the different parts of ourselves is so close that we cannot recognise that revelation without consenting to it.

## 4. Reference
**There is a meaning that belongs to the relation of the part to the Whole, but it is only the figure of essential meaning, which resides in act—in the reference of each particular act to an absolute act that eternally wills itself.**

From a static point of view, considering the universe as a Whole composed of harmoniously assembled parts, one may view meaning as the relation uniting each part to the Whole by showing the unique, specific function each fulfils within the Whole’s equilibrium. This viewpoint must not be neglected; whenever meaning intervenes, a reference to the Whole is at stake. Yet this is only an expression—in the language of the given—of the significative function that posits meaning instead of containing it. Meaning always derives from the act that, in positing the thing, gives it meaning. It is therefore a mistake to think that the meaning of an act resides in the thing or in the end it seeks to attain; rather, the thing has meaning only through the act that produces it. That act itself, always a particular act, has meaning only in relation to an absolute act that eternally wills itself.

## 5. Reciprocity
**The relation between meaning and action is reciprocal: it is in acting that we discover meaning, and meaning in turn directs our action.**

Meaning is not detached contemplation; it is bound up with the action through which it is discovered. The act reveals its own meaning only in being exercised. Conversely, once discovered, meaning becomes the rule that directs our action. Every act thus carries within itself both the discovery and the realisation of meaning.

## 6. Absolute
**Essential meaning, founded in act, derives from the absolute subject and returns to it.**

The absolute subject is the source from which all meaning flows. Every particular act, insofar as it participates in the absolute act, draws from it the power to signify. Meaning therefore has an absolute origin and an absolute end; it proceeds from the absolute subject and leads back to it by the mediation of our own acts.

## 7. Time
**Meaning is inseparable from time; it directs time even as it is realised within time.**

Meaning unfolds within time, yet it is not subservient to time. It directs time in the sense that it assigns orientation to our temporal existence. Each act discovers within the moment the reference to an absolute act that transcends temporal succession, while at the same time realising that reference in the very flow of time.

## 8. Intention
**Meaning is intentional: it is the projection of our acts toward an ideal that transcends them.**

Because meaning belongs to act, it is intentional. Each act projects itself beyond what it is, towards an ideal that it acknowledges without ever exhausting. Meaning is the orientation of the act toward that ideal; it is the tension of the act beyond itself.

## 9. Invention
**What we call invention with respect to ourselves is discovery with respect to being, and conversely.**

We often oppose invention to discovery, as though the former created what did not exist while the latter merely uncovered what already was. For the philosopher these two movements coincide. Every genuine invention is a discovery of being, and every discovery of being requires the inventive effort of the mind that sets itself in motion in order to welcome what it receives.

## 10. Mind
**There is meaning only for a mind or for consciousness; the meaning of the world is that it allows consciousness to be.**

Meaning exists only for a mind, for consciousness. The meaning of the world is therefore that it renders consciousness possible: the world is the milieu in which consciousness discovers itself, expresses itself, and realises itself. Without consciousness the world would be meaningless; without the world consciousness could neither discover nor actualise meaning.

## 11. Production
**Meaning is neither purely objective nor purely subjective; it is produced in the encounter of the subject with the object.**

Meaning is not located exclusively in things nor exclusively in the mind. It is produced where subject and object meet. The subject brings to the object an activity capable of revealing its meaning; the object offers to the subject the resistance and richness that enable the act to discover its own significance. Meaning is the result of their interaction.

## 12. Duality
**We must distinguish between the object as spectacle and the object as value.**

The object presents itself to us under a double aspect: as spectacle, offered to our contemplation, and as value, calling upon our will. As spectacle it is ordered by the understanding; as value it is ordered by freedom. Meaning arises from the interplay of these two aspects, for the object has meaning only when the spectacle it offers becomes the bearer of a value we consent to will.

## 13. Objectivity
**The meaning of the real does not abolish its objectivity but reveals it.**

To say that the real has meaning is not to dissolve it into representation. Meaning reveals objectivity instead of negating it. The real is most objective when its relation to the act that posits it is fully recognised: the object then appears with the solidity of what participates in the absolute act.

## 14. Value
**Meaning culminates in value.**

Values are meanings that have become objects of love and of will. When an idea is willed, it ceases to be a mere possibility and becomes a value. The discovery of meaning therefore culminates in the recognition of values, through which the world and action receive their orientation.

## 15. Understanding
**To discover meaning is to understand—to relate each isolated term to every other.**

Understanding consists in grasping how each element of experience relates to all the others. An isolated element is unintelligible; it becomes meaningful only through the network of relations that connects it with the totality of being. To understand is therefore to “take together” (cum-prehendere) the diverse aspects of reality within a unity of meaning.

## 16. Participation
**The key to discovery is the theory of participation, which reconciles empiricism and rationalism.**

Empiricism insists that we do not create the object of knowledge; it is given to us as something to be possessed. Rationalism responds that we know only through an act of consciousness. Participation reconciles these claims. The subject’s activity is always a participated activity: it receives from the absolute act the power to relate to the datum that answers it. The given and the act are thus inseparable; meaning arises from their participation.

## 17. Illumination
**Meaning is an illumination of the real—a light that makes the real transparent without abolishing it.**

When meaning is discovered, the real is illuminated. This illumination does not dissipate the real; it renders it transparent. The real continues to exist in its solidity, yet the light of meaning allows us to see it from within, to discern the act that sustains it.

## 18. Dissociation
**Reflection dissociates the real and the possible in order to relate them anew.**

The reflective act distinguishes the real from the possible so that it may relate them in a deeper fashion. By dissociating them, it enables the subject to grasp the real as what has been actualized from a field of possibilities and to discern within the possible the appeal to be actualized. Meaning lies in this play between what is and what could be.

## 19. Future
**Meaning always opens onto the future.**

Because meaning is related to act, it opens us to what is yet to come. To understand the meaning of the present is to discern the direction in which it calls us. Meaning therefore involves a promise; it sends us toward a future in which what is implicit may become explicit.

## 20. Exploration
**Meaning calls for an ever-renewed exploration of the real.**

To discover meaning is not to reach a terminus; it invites us to explore the real endlessly. Each discovery reveals new horizons that demand to be traversed. The dialectic of meaning and act thus propels us forward in a never-finished quest.

## 21. Description
**Meaning is discovered through a description of the relations that unite us to the universe to which we remain interior.**

Method does not consist in withdrawing from the universe in order to reconstruct it from without. Reflection places us within a universe whose articulations we must describe in relation to ourselves. Meaning is discovered by describing these relations—by recognising how, through participation, we are interior to the universe we seek to understand.
