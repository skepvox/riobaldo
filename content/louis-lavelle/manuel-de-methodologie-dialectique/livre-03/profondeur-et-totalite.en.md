## 64. Levels
**The different levels of the real may be traversed vertically or horizontally.**

The dialectic originates in the act of freedom through which the self constitutes itself by participating in the absolute. The interval opened by participation can be filled only by the reality that answers it. The dialectic therefore describes the correspondences that allow us to descend from the absolute to the most delicate forms of the sensible (and to ascend in the opposite direction), while also following, at every level, the horizontal relations among the forms of reality encountered there.

## 65. Perception
**Perception places us within the real instead of forcing us outside ourselves to reach it.**

To perceive is not to leave oneself; it is to discover that the world already inhabits us. Perception situates us immediately within the real by revealing the correspondence between the object and the perspective from which we grasp it.

## 66. Memory
**Memory mirrors perception.**

Memory treats perception as perception treated the object. It allows us to recover the presence of what has been perceived by relating it to the act that once grasped it. Memory thus renews perception in the light of consciousness.

## 67. Coincidence
**Perception and memory coincide at their origin.**

At the instant in which perception occurs, memory is already present within it. The two are then indistinguishable; only later do they separate. Their coincidence marks the unity of consciousness as it seizes the real.

## 68. Distinction
**The real and the possible are distinct yet inseparable.**

Perception gives us what is; memory opens us to what could be. The real and the possible answer one another: the real is illuminated by the possible, the possible is rooted in the real. Consciousness moves between them.

## 69. Identification
**To perceive is to identify oneself with the act that posits the object.**

The subject does not identify itself with the object, but with the act through which the object is posited. In perception the subject recognises itself as this act; the object thus becomes transparent to the subject.

## 70. Perspective
**Every object is defined by perspective.**

An object is never given outside a perspective; the perspective is not an accident but a constitutive element of the object for consciousness. The dialectic therefore studies the variety of perspectives and the way they intersect within the totality of being.

## 71. Memory
**Memory reveals the mobility of the self.**

In remembering, the self discovers that it is not fixed. Memory shows that the self can take up again the acts it has accomplished and open them to new possibilities. The dialectic of memory and perception allows the self to deepen its own identity.

## 72. Detachment
**Reflection detaches us from the object only to allow us to take possession of it.**

By reflecting, the subject separates itself from the sensible object and subordinates it to reason; it then subordinates reason to value. Each detachment is a new possession, for the object now receives its place within the hierarchy of participation.

## 73. Richness
**Ideas are richer and poorer than sensible reality.**

Ideas demand to be embodied in the sensible, just as the pure subject seeks incarnation in the psychological subject. The sensible adds something to the idea, yet the idea contains possibilities that no sensible form exhausts. The dialectic maintains this tension between richness and poverty.

## 74. Interval
**Between subject and object lies an interval that the world fills.**

The psychological, transcendental, and absolute subjects are distinct only by analysis. The real fills the intervals that separate them: the sensible world between the psychological and the transcendental, the world of ideas between the transcendental and the absolute. The world is therefore the medium of participation.

## 75. Idea
**Ideas are the mediations through which the absolute communicates itself.**

An idea is not a mere abstraction; it is the form in which the absolute offers itself to the transcendental subject. Through ideas the absolute communicates the possibilities that the individual subject is called to actualize.

## 76. Thought
**Thought discovers its own origin in the act that thinks it.**

Reflective thought seeks to trace itself back to the act that sustains it. The thought of thought reveals that thought cannot become an object without ceasing to be thought: it is an act whose light is identical with itself.

## 77. Value
**Value is the goal toward which freedom is oriented.**

Values are the forms under which the absolute proposes itself to the will. They gather ideas and sensible realities into aims that freedom can love and realise. Through value, the world of action is ordered to the absolute.

## 78. Love
**Love realises the highest form of participation.**

In love the subject goes beyond knowledge and action to unite itself with the value it recognises. Love is the act through which participation becomes communion.

## 79. Action
**Action converts possibility into reality.**

Freedom is exercised by actualising the possibilities presented to it. Action is therefore the place where the dialectic of the possible and the real is resolvedâ€”where the subject becomes the creator of itself.

## 80. Movement
**Being is movement; the dialectic follows its rhythm.**

Being is not static. The dialectic accompanies its movement, attentive to the transitions through which the real passes from one level of participation to another. Movement is the manifestation of the act that sustains the world.

## 81. Creation
**Creation is participation raised to its highest degree.**

To create is to participate most closely in the absolute act. Every genuine creation is the actualisation of a possibility offered by the absolute, realised by the individual subject with its own initiative.

## 82. Concept
**Concepts summarise the discoveries of participation.**

Concepts are not substitutes for experience; they are the residues of discoveries, the marks left by acts of participation. They guide new acts by recalling the paths already travelled.

## 83. Testimony
**The world bears testimony to participation.**

Things and ideas witness to the acts that have produced them. By contemplating the world we read the traces of participation and are invited to continue it.

## 84. Incarnation
**The absolute is incarnated in the world through participation.**

The absolute remains transcendent, yet it is incarnated in the sensible and intelligible worlds through the participation of subjects. Depth and totality are achieved when this incarnation is recognised and fulfilled.
