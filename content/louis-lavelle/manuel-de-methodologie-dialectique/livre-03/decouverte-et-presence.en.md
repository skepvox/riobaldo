## 22. Description
**The task is not to construct the world but to describe it.**

For a long time it was believed that we can understand only what we are able to construct. Such is the ambition of idealism. The given is imposed upon us and therefore seems unintelligible; what we construct is our own work, the place where we rediscover ourselves. Yet to reduce the real to a construction of the mind would be a vain enterprise leading only to self-enclosure. Even if the mind could construct everything that can become an object of experience, it could not construct itself. The mind discovers itself in the eternal act that makes it be—an act that is not a construction in which the mind would be both the builder and the built, but a ceaseless renewal of its own presence to itself. The real that matters to us—our own existence, the existence of others, the absolute subject—can only be encountered, not fabricated. Philosophical discovery thus takes the form of a description through which we learn to recognise and welcome what is present.

## 23. Correlation
**Every act calls for a correlated datum.**

The act of consciousness is absolute and yet does not suffice unto itself. It is engaged in time; it tends toward an end other than itself, the possession of which it seeks. Every act therefore calls for a datum that answers it. There is no act of knowledge without an object known; desire and will aspire toward a good that comes to them from without; love implies the presence of another being. Discovery is the adjustment between the operation we accomplish and the datum that responds to it.

## 24. Datum
**The datum is both point of departure and point of arrival.**

The datum we encounter is not poor or insignificant; it possesses a concrete richness that we never completely embrace. We reach it only by rediscovering it, by deepening it. Discovery is not a departure from the datum but its renewed appropriation. The datum is the starting point of our act, which questions it; it is also the point of arrival, the fulfilment of the act that recognises it.

## 25. Gift
**The datum is at once a gift and an enrichment.**

By presenting itself, the datum allows consciousness to leave itself without abandoning its interiority. Thought does not abolish the real; it receives it as a gift. In welcoming it the mind is enriched, for the given enlarges the horizon of participation and offers the occasion for new acts.

## 26. Correspondence
**Discovery is the correspondence of operation and datum.**

The act seeks its datum; the datum calls for the act that reveals it. Discovery occurs when the two coincide. In knowing, loving, or willing, we establish a correspondence between what we do and what is offered to us. The mind is neither passive nor omnipotent; it participates through this correspondence.

## 27. Modes
**There are different modes of presence, corresponding to the different modes of participation.**

Presence is not homogeneous. The sensible object, the idea, the value—each presents itself according to its own mode. The psychological subject participates in the sensible, the transcendental subject in the intelligible, the absolute subject in the order of value. Discovery must respect this hierarchy of presences.

## 28. Solidarity
**The datum is never isolated; it is linked to every other datum of experience.**

Each discovery situates the datum within the solidarity that unites the elements of experience. Nothing stands alone. To discover is to relate what is encountered to the whole of experience in which it takes its place.

## 29. Middle Way
**The method strikes a middle path between mere description and pure construction.**

Empiricism would have us limit ourselves to describing what is given; idealism would have us construct it. Discovery lies between these two extremes. It respects the given while recognising the activity that brings it into the light.

## 30. Novelty
**Discovery carries a double meaning of novelty.**

Human beings crave novelty and often see invention as the expression of creative power. Yet the deepest novelty is that of a reality we already bear within us or that has long been offered to us without our perceiving it. Philosophical discovery is always the unveiling of a hidden presence.

## 31. Hypothesis
**Hypotheses are inventions; truth is discovery.**

We invent hypotheses; we discover reality. The work of inquiry begins with inventions that orient our search, but it culminates only when hypotheses are verified by the presence of what is. At the moment of triumph, invention effaces itself in favour of discovery.

## 32. Relations
**Description extends to the relations among things and between things and consciousness.**

Discovery does not concern isolated terms but the relations that unite them. To describe is to relate. The meaning of each element emerges only through the network of relations that binds it to consciousness and to the universe.

## 33. Explanation
**Explaining is showing how the datum corresponds to the act that grasps it.**

Explanations do not dissolve the real; they exhibit the correspondence between what is given and the operation by which it is seized. To explain is to reveal the conditions that make discovery possible.

## 34. Total Presence
**Presence is never partial; it engages the whole subject.**

When the mind discovers, it does so with the entirety of its powers. Presence engages the psychological, the transcendental, and the absolute dimensions of the subject. Discovery is total because the subject is wholly present to what it recognises.

## 35. Immediacy
**Presence is immediate without being naive.**

The presence discovered is immediate: we are in contact with what is. Yet this immediacy is not that of naïve perception; it is the fruit of an act that has passed through analysis and has returned to what is given with a new clarity.

## 36. Active Rest
**Discovery joins rest and activity.**

Presence is a rest: the mind receives what is. Yet it is an active rest, for receiving is already an act. Discovery unites these two moments: the repose of acceptance and the effort of attention.

## 37. Analysis
**Presence is deepened by analysis.**

To recognise what is present does not mean to leave it unanalyzed. On the contrary, analysis allows us to penetrate the datum further, to discover the richness it contains, and to integrate it more fully into the whole.

## 38. Surpassing
**Presence surpasses itself toward a more complete presence.**

Every discovery calls for a new discovery. Presence is not a fixed state; it opens onto a more complete presence. To discover is to set oneself on the path of an endless surpassing.

## 39. Infinite
**Presence is the threshold of the infinite.**

In discovering what is present we touch the infinite, for the datum participates in the absolute act. Each presence is a window onto the inexhaustible depth of being.

## 40. Reconciliation
**Presence reconciles the subject with the world.**

Through discovery the subject is reconciled with the world. The world is no longer foreign; it reveals itself as the place where the subject encounters the absolute. Presence pacifies, gathering the subject and the world within the same participation.

## 41. Identity
**Presence is the identity of the subject with itself.**

In presence the subject is identical with itself. By welcoming what is, it recognises itself as the very act that receives it. Discovery therefore consolidates the identity of the subject.

## 42. Call
**Presence calls the subject.**

The datum calls upon us; it appeals to our act. Discovery is a response to that call. Presence is never neutral; it summons the subject to attention and consent.

## 43. Encounter
**Presence is an encounter.**

Discovering is meeting the real. Presence is the face-to-face between the subject and what is offered to it. It is in this encounter that meaning is born.

## 44. Immanence
**Presence is immanent: we discover the absolute within the given.**

The absolute is not outside the datum we encounter. It is discovered within it. Presence teaches us that the absolute is immanent to our experience without ceasing to transcend it.

## 45. Anticipation
**Presence anticipates what it allows us to realise.**

What we discover is already within us as possibility, yet the datum precedes our act: it anticipates the act that actualises it. Presence is therefore both anterior and posterior to our operation—it calls us and is fulfilled in us.

## 46. Evidence
**Presence produces evidence.**

When operation and datum coincide, evidence arises. Evidence is not a formal rule but the luminous presence of what cannot be denied, because act and datum mutually confirm one another.

## 47. Fulfilment
**Discovery is the fulfilment of the various forms of participation.**

Discovery actualises participation in its different degrees: sensible, intelligible, axiological. Each fulfilment prepares the next and reveals the unity of participation.

## 48. Being
**Discovery resolves the antinomy of being and appearance.**

Presence shows that appearance is already a mode of being. The datum that appears points beyond itself to the act that grounds it. Discovery reconciles being and appearance by revealing their common root in participation.

## 49. Opening
**Discovery is an opening onto the absolute and the infinite.**

Philosophical discovery never ends with a particular solution. Every discovery opens us to the absolute and to the infinite; it reveals both the thing discovered and the path that leads beyond it. Presence is therefore an inexhaustible openness.
