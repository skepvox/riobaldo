## 42. Interest
**Analysis always begins along a determinate line of interest and continues along divergent lines of interest that take their origin in each new revelation of the analysis.**

It is not enough to regard every discovery as the effect of analysis. What matters is to know how analysis begins. But if the whole at which analysis takes aim (in an act that is an act of participation rather than an act of division) always remains present to us, and if all the elements that compose it are mutually supportive, there is no absolute beginning valid for every consciousness. Each one follows a certain line of interest at the end of which attention singles out a datum correlated with the operation that releases it. That first effect of analysis arouses a new interest that leads attention into a divergent path; the process seems arbitrary only because the different interests that can direct the movement of consciousness are not themselves classified. The interest of deductive implication is one such line, but there is also the interest of an emotive diffusion or deepening, of an increase in power, and so on. In order to reserve the whole energy of consciousness for one of them, all the others—which are always associated with it in the concrete movements of our life—must be resisted. The essential point, therefore, in applying the method is to define precisely the line of interest one wishes to follow.

## 43. Solidarity
**Every particular item of knowledge forms part of a whole within which a circular solidarity reigns.**

The reversibility of analysis and synthesis is nothing more than a sign of the circular solidarity of all our knowledge: each of these operations is defined by our concern either to reach the ultimate element (operation or datum) that brings analysis to an end, or to rediscover, starting from that element and composing it with itself, the results of a less advanced analysis on which our attention had successively halted before attaining it. The synthesis that here appears is nothing more than the relation established in reverse among the successive operations through which analysis proceeds. But analysis does not necessarily pursue the simple. Every kind of analysis brings out, within the real, an aspect or a perspective that we know neither suffices on its own, even though it also allows us, taking it as point of departure, to recover—along with the other aspects—all the other perspectives we can isolate inside the real.

## 44. Constitution
**Analysis does not consist in separating the constituent parts of a Whole, but in making them appear in such a way that the Whole itself is constituted as a whole.**

At first glance nothing seems more sterile than analysis, since it apparently consists in isolating, within a Whole, parts that are already there. In fact things are otherwise. Analysis is creative. The parts are present in the whole only in potency, not in act. Every operation of analysis is original: it is an invention, the product of freedom, and might never have taken place. Analysis is, so to speak, the Analysis of pure act as realized through participation. Each operation of participation is incomplete and calls for a datum that answers it. The whole is therefore posterior to analysis rather than anterior to it: analysis contributes to forming the whole rather than presupposing it. That whole remains open, however, in the sense that new operations of analysis ceaselessly bring to light new riches within it.

## 45. Correlation
**The correlation between operations and data is found again in analysis, which is inseparably in us an analysis of our powers and outside us an analysis of things.**

Analysis is itself an operation of the mind, yet it never subsists in isolation; it always makes a correlated datum appear. The mind, naturally turned toward the object, imagines that one and the same operation makes different things appear in the world. In reality the mind’s operations are never the same; they differ from one another just as the data to which they apply differ, whether, as empiricism believes, they adopt the form of those data, or, as idealism believes, they produce that form. Yet neither of these two conceptions can explain the correlation of operations and data, which is of a somewhat different nature: the operation calls for the datum instead of presupposing it. Still, the operation does not create the datum, for the datum expresses, in the world, precisely what the operation lacks. We must not suppose that analysis simply bears upon a pre-existing world where it confines itself to cutting out data; nor may we content ourselves with the thought that those data merely trace the contours of the operation. From the moment it begins to be carried out, the operation is itself the analysis of the undivided power of the self. It is the analysis of this power that calls forth the analysis of the real into different data, causing them, as it were, to emerge so that they may respond to the diversity of our operations.

## 46. Diversity
**This analysis brings to light the triple diversity of consciousnesses, ideas, and things.**

The analysis that undergirds all the others and makes them possible is the one that reveals, in the world, a plurality of different consciousnesses. Conversely one must say that each particular consciousness is itself the very instrument of every analysis. It is thus both the cause and the effect of analysis—a fact that will seem less surprising if one remembers that it can constitute itself only through the participation of the individual self in the pure spirit. The plurality of ideas corresponds to an analysis carried out by the transcendental self, the plurality of things to an analysis carried out by the individual self. Yet, in fact, the diversity of ideas and of things—if we find in the former the operations that think them and in the latter the sensations through which they reveal themselves to us—expresses nothing more than the correlation of operation and datum.

## 47. Universality
**Method makes sense only for a subject, yet it must be practicable by every subject.**

The method is, properly speaking, a path: the path along which a subject proposes to travel, in a regulated order, through all the domains of being so as to discover the connections that unite them. One may even say that the distinctive character of the method is to be a kind of relation between the activity of finite consciousness and the totality of its possible object. That this relation implies a rule is a sign both of the demands of our mind and of its necessary subordination to the whole it seeks to explore. For all that, the method is always a choice carried out by freedom, and one can even conceive that, within the method, the dispositions of the individual subject come into play: one sees each person, contrary to Descartes’s claim, adopting to some degree a method of their own. Generally speaking, however, the word method designates rules that suit not merely this or that subject but the subject in general—or at least it retains within the method only those rules that can be practiced by everyone, even if each person, in applying them, may specify them for themselves through an individual methodology.

## 48. Values
**Method is inseparable from value.**

Method is not concerned solely with the order of thought; it governs conduct as well. Through the order it introduces among our thoughts, it determines the order we bring into our actions. Now every action presupposes a hierarchy of values. Method therefore cannot be separated from value; it expresses the direction of the will as much as the orientation of the intelligence. It is the will that chooses the path the intelligence will follow. In the method, theoretical exigency and moral exigency meet.

## 49. Focus
**The subject is a kind of focus from which radiate interconnected operations that must allow us to derive every aspect of real or possible experience.**

The mind has always been tempted by the ambition of deriving the representation of the world from itself. It is the chimera of this enterprise that has led philosophers to oppose matter to form. Such an ambition was bound to fail, especially through an insufficient study of the nature of the subject. Were the subject a purely creative activity, it is hard to see why it would need to create a world or why that world would be such and not otherwise—why it would not be the product of arbitrary caprice. Yet if the subject necessarily unites, inseparably, the individual, reason, and the absolute spirit, one readily understands why the mere mutual relation among these three aspects of the subject must produce—not, to be sure, the concrete experience that cannot be deduced any more than the existence of the subject itself and is correlated with it—but the conditions of possibility of that experience, at the level of values, concepts, or sensible qualities. The subject is a focus from which radiate a plurality of interdependent operations that, by their mutual relation, make it possible to define the different domains of experience.

## 50. Inscription
**Our inscription in the world is possible only through the distinction among the three modes of subjectivity.**

If we were nothing more than a part of the world, we could not know it. That knowledge could belong only to a being that overarches the world and would no longer be ourselves. Now we embrace the world from an individual perspective, and whoever does not go beyond that perspective locks themselves inside a solipsistic idealism. At the same time we think ourselves as having an individual perspective on the world and as a unique centre of reference with respect to the world. By that very token we also think other beings who are for us different centres of reference. Then we can think ourselves as part of a world considered not as a plurality of objects, but as a plurality of consciousnesses. The subject in general already expresses the unity of the world insofar as its diversity of individual perspectives does not break that unity. Yet for the unity of this world not to remain purely abstract, every one of these real consciousnesses must not only be similar to one another but also united in the common participation of an absolute subjectivity.

## 51. Threefold Relation
**Idea, concept, and category express the operation of the transcendental subject in its threefold relation with the psychological subject, with the absolute subject, or with itself.**

Nothing is more difficult than to distinguish the meanings of the three terms idea, concept, and category, which are almost always confused. The idea is the object proper to the transcendental subject; it expresses the distance between the activity the subject exercises and the activity of the absolute subject. In the interval the idea appears, through which the absolute subject reveals to the transcendental subject the infinity of its act as a datum that always surpasses the subject and that it never finishes exhausting. The idea is not the concept, however; the concept is definition. It has meaning only in relation to experience and expresses an abstract construction that refers, either directly or indirectly, to the experience of the psychological subject—as one sees in mathematical and empirical concepts. The category is the law according to which the transcendental subject acts without thereby making us know any object, idea, or concept; it expresses the most general conditions of participation and provides the modes through which I can think experience. The same word can designate an idea, a concept, or a category. There is thus an idea of space—which Malebranche and Bossuet viewed as God Himself—or an idea of infinity, conceived as the perfection toward which the mind tends without ever reaching it. There is a concept of space—Euclidean space—and a category of space and time that determines both the general conditions of participation and the form of the mind’s receptivity.

## 52. Appearance
**The same reality offers itself under three aspects: reality, appearance, and phenomenon.**

Every real being presents itself to us, above all, as reality—that is, as the product of its own activity, whether it be ours or that of another being. That applies even to those realities that seem purely inert: they retain at least the traces of the activity that produced them. It presents itself next as appearance—namely, as what reveals itself through our activity to our mind. Finally it presents itself as phenomenon—that is, as what we can grasp through an act of consciousness. These three aspects correspond to the absolute subject, to the transcendental subject, and to the psychological subject respectively. Reality is the act of the absolute subject, appearance the act of the transcendental subject, phenomenon the act of the psychological subject. The same being thus offers itself to us under three different lights without the slightest discontinuity; the difference lies in the point of view we adopt.

## 53. Mobility
**This threefold gaze corresponds to a threefold mobility: that of the thing in its origin, that of the idea in its content, that of the consciousness in its operation.**

Every being is in motion, whether in the creative act that produces it, or in the intelligible form that defines it, or in the consciousness that apprehends it. The object is mobile in its origin: it is born from a creative activity. The idea is mobile in its content: it yields to an inexhaustible analysis. Consciousness is mobile in its operation: it renews itself at every instant. Reflection therefore introduces us to a world of mobility that admits of no fixed reality. The same motion is grasped at three successive levels: creative mobility, intelligible mobility, phenomenal mobility. The dialectic follows these three movements and extracts from them their reciprocal order.

## 54. Method
**The dialectic is the method of participation.**

The dialectic is nothing other than the method of participation. It is through it that we determine how the individual subject joins the transcendental subject and how the transcendental subject participates in the absolute subject. The dialectic is therefore the science of the relations among subjects, and through them the science of relations among ideas and among things. It teaches how every being, every idea, every thing is placed and defined within the totality of Being.

## 55. Exchange
**Participation is always a double exchange between what is received and what is given.**

Every participation presupposes a twofold movement. On the one hand the subject receives from the absolute the power to be; on the other it gives back that power by actualizing it. The absolute offers possibilities; the subject actualizes them. Participation is thus an exchange between gift and reception. The subject owes everything to the absolute; yet the absolute asks of the subject that it consent to become what it can be. Without that consent there is no participation.

## 56. Aim
**Participation always aims at union without ever abolishing distinction.**

The end of participation is union. The subject tends toward the absolute in order to unite with it. Yet that union never abolishes the distinction between them. The subject remains finite even while being raised to the level of the absolute. Participation is therefore an incorporation into the absolute without confusion with it. There is neither fusion nor identification, but communion.

## 57. Conditions
**Participation implies a double condition: the gift of the absolute and the freedom of the subject.**

The absolute must give itself; the subject must receive. But the subject can receive only by freely consenting. Participation therefore presupposes both the generosity of the absolute and the liberty of the subject. The absolute does not impose itself; it offers itself. The subject is never forced; it is invited.

## 58. Terminus
**Participation always ends in beatitude.**

Participation is a joy, for it is union with the absolute. The absolute is the plenitude of being; to participate in it is to taste the fullness of being. Every true participation therefore has as its term beatitude. The dialectic ultimately leads to blessedness, for it leads to union with the absolute.

## 59. Reversal
**Participation reverses the relation between the possible and the real.**

Ordinarily we think that the possible precedes the real. Participation shows on the contrary that the real precedes the possible. The absolute is pure act; it contains no possibility separated from act. Possibilities arise only when participation begins—that is, when the subject appears. For the subject, the absolute then becomes an inexhaustible bundle of possibilities always offered to it and never exhausted by it. Yet in itself the absolute remains pure efficacy, indivisible actuality. Relative to the absolute self, the individual self is nothing but a possibility whose actualization is left to it, even though it receives its very power to actualize from the absolute.

## 60. Creation of Consciousnesses
**The creation of the world is the creation of different consciousnesses.**

When people speak of creation they often mean that it bears upon the universe of objects. Yet no object has meaning except for a subject, for a consciousness that perceives it outside itself albeit in relation to itself. Thus not only is there solidarity between perceived object and perceiving subject, but there is also the primacy of the perceiving subject over the perceived object. The object expresses, in the totality of being, what limits the subject’s own operation even as it completes it and answers it. The creation of consciousnesses therefore appears as the very condition of the creation of the world of objects, and not the reverse: first because consciousnesses are beings whose objects are phenomena, next because the world of objects is the means whereby the different consciousnesses distinguish themselves from one another and yet communicate. Creation itself is nothing more than an ever-offered participation. The proper function of the infinite act is not to suffice unto itself, but to give itself—and to give itself infinitely. For that gift to be the gift of itself, that is, of an act and not of a thing, it can be only the offer of a possibility each being actualizes, thereby becoming, in the passage from possibility to actuality, the creator of itself—which is precisely the definition of a consciousness. The world expresses all the conditions that must be gathered so that this possibility can form; once they are gathered, taking possession of them and the use we can make of them express, within participation, a reciprocal relation between the absolute of pure act and the absolute of our free act—the former being the foundation of the latter, and the latter its implementation in us and by us.

The distinction among the three modalities of the subject is realized through participation, which implies a double opposition between operation and datum, and between possibility and reality. If the “I” is only a mediator between the “me” and the “self,” it is easy to see that the distinction among the three modes of the subject is intended solely to justify the participation of individual being in absolute being. Reduce participation to two terms and it includes a participant and a participated. The participant is the very operation through which participation is accomplished—it always takes place at the level of the “I”; the participated is act at the level of the absolute subject and datum at the level of the individual subject. Participation as such therefore always presupposes the opposition between an operation and a datum. In the same way it presupposes the opposition between possibility and reality: possibility is always delivered at the level of the “I,” and beyond possibility lies the absolute being from which it draws, as well as the actualization of that possibility in the individual, which constitutes reality.

## 61. Possibilizing
**Reflection is nothing more than the possibilizing of the real.**

Reflection is plainly the act through which the subject takes possession of itself—that is, of its subjectivity and of the activity proper to it, meaning an activity the self can call its own, in which no passive or foreign element remains, one it pervades entirely and can justify by reasons. This activity discovers itself and wins its independence by separating itself from the real as it is given to it—which does not mean separating itself from Being. In separating itself, however, it remains bound to the real. With respect to the real it calls into question, reflection may be defined as a possibility. Since it knows nothing other than this real, from which it nonetheless separates itself, and since it can think that real and think it other than it is, reflection is, so to speak, the possibilizing of the whole real. That stretches far beyond the real such as it is given to us. Yet when we say that in this very act the subject is not foreign to being, we would be denying not only every content to it, but even preventing it from subsisting as formal being, if we refused to define it otherwise than as the possibilizing of every possible object.

## 62. Design
**The possibilizing of the real cannot be dissociated from the design I form with respect to the real, which cannot consist merely in rediscovering, starting from the possible, the real that had been left behind, but must judge the real and modify it.**

One might suppose that I am absorbed by the very presence of a reality—and of my own reality as it is given—or that I am content to let myself be carried by it without managing to free myself from it. That is what happens in purely spontaneous existence, prior to the exercise of reflection. The act of reflection is the very act of my freedom. For it to be exercised, however, I must find in the very conditions of my spontaneous existence an occasion that allows it to come into play or simply to become conscious of itself. Must we say that it is the dissatisfaction I feel before reality as it is given? That dissatisfaction is itself merely a sign of the presence within me of an activity that surpasses the given and, precisely because it bears the infinite within itself, is capable of separating itself from the given, of asking it for its title to existence, and of modifying it in order to seek within it an ever more perfect testimony.

## 63. Regions
**Within the totality of being, the real and the possible mark out nothing more than different regions.**

The dissociation of the real and the possible—the very act of reflection—does not take us out of the domain of being; it occurs within that domain itself. The possible is not nothing; it is a being of thought. If one insists on distinguishing between actual thought and possible thought, such that there would be both the actuality of thought inasmuch as it is the possibility of the real, and the possibility of such and such a thought inasmuch as it has no actuality of its own, the answer is that actual thought contains within itself every possible, even though they are not all actualized at once in psychological consciousness. Consequently one must not distinguish between the possible that is thought and the possible that is not yet thought but could be, for within actual thought it enjoys an implicated actuality, albeit unanalyzed. Within the totality of being, therefore, the real and the possible simply furnish different regions that correspond to the distinctions among the modes of the subject.

## 64. Engendering
**The possibility of things derives from a sort of analysis of pure act, which puts at the disposal of the transcendental subject an infinite reserve of possible operations.**

The possibility that reflection posits is not arbitrary. It stems from the very analysis of pure act. The transcendental subject, by analyzing the act of the absolute, extracts from it the possibilities it can offer to the individual subject. Possibility is thus the effect of an analysis of pure act, which the transcendental subject undertakes so that the individual subject may actualize it. This is why the transcendental subject, situated between the absolute and the individual, is a principle of election: it constantly borrows from the absolute subject those possibilities that answer to the requirements or solicitations issuing from the individual subject, whether to explain what is given to the latter or to modify it within the circumstances arising from its situation.

## 65. Idea of Possibility
**The notion of possibility involves a characteristic reversal: it first reduces the real as such to the possible by tracing the path that ascends from the individual self to the transcendental self, then it becomes the path through which possibility results from an analysis of pure act so that the individual subject can actualize it.**

Possibility presents two aspects. It first expresses a reduction of the given to an operation of the mind—that is, a passage from the individual self to the transcendental self. How can this conversion of the given into the possible take place? Evidently by a return to the absolute subject as the real source of everything that is and everything that can be. The role of the transcendental subject is simply to mediate it, so as to allow the individual self to actualize it. The idea of possibility therefore inverts itself: it reduces the real to the possible, but, beyond this reduction, it is itself the effect of an analysis of pure act destined to provide the individual subject with what it will have to actualize.

## 66. Actuality
**My actuality is the actuality of my own possibility—which is the possibility both of myself and of the Whole.**

When we inquire what constitutes the existence of my own self, we cannot reduce it either to that of my body, or to that of my states, or even to the tendencies or habits that make up my nature and impose themselves on me in spite of myself. The self continues to deserve its name only so long as it is still a possibility capable of actualizing itself, thereby surpassing all those formations that are already realized possibilities. My true actuality is my own possibility. It is not indeterminate, for it is, as it were, oriented and already engaged—even if it is with respect to it that I strive to free myself—by everything in me that has already been transformed into nature. Yet a path opens before me, starting from what I am, toward the very possibilities that are immediately offered to me: my situation in the world, the order of events in time, will allow me to discern them, to establish among them an order of urgency in their actualization. Participation would cease, I would no longer be united to the absolute act through the mediation of the transcendental subject, and I would not myself form part of the world, if every possibility were not, in some way, present to me. I must therefore define myself indivisibly as the possibility of the Whole and as the possibility of myself.

## 67. Election
**Participation requires an election through which the transcendental subject chooses among the possibilities offered by the absolute to fit the solicitations of the individual subject.**

The transcendental subject does not passively receive the possibilities the absolute offers; it elects among them those that can answer to the expectations of the individual subject. This election is guided both by the appeal of the individual situation and by the aim of the absolute. Participation is thus a discernment, a choice in which the transcendental subject mediates between the infinite richness of act and the finite needs of the individual.

## 68. Actualization of the World
**The world is the scene where possibilities become reality.**

The world furnishes every condition required for the formation of possibility. When those conditions are gathered, the world becomes the place where possibility passes into actuality. Each being appropriates the world in its own way, and through this appropriation actualizes the possibilities it has chosen. The world is therefore the theatre of actualization, the space where participation becomes effective.

## 69. Reversal
**There is a characteristic reversal in the formation of the idea of possibility, which first reduces the real to the possible and then derives possibility from the analysis of pure act so that the individual subject may actualize it.**

Possibility may be considered under two different aspects. It begins as a reduction of the given to an operation of the mind; it is the movement by which one ascends from the individual self to the transcendental self. But this conversion of the given into the possible presupposes a return to the absolute subject, the real source of everything that is and everything that can be. The function of the transcendental subject is to mediate the absolute in such a way as to make it actualizable in an individual subject. Hence possibility, traced back to its source, is the result of the analysis of pure act, whose fruit the transcendental subject puts at the disposal of the individual subject.

## 70. Participation
**A second reversal peculiar to participation makes it so that the absolute Act can be considered an infinite bundle of possibilities only in relation to me who participate in it; in itself it is pure efficacy or undivided actuality, so that relative to it individual subjects and particular things are the possibilities that must always be distinguished in order to be separately actualized.**

Possibility exists only at the level of the transcendental subject; it is furnished by the absolute subject and has meaning only for the individual subject. From the perspective of the individual subject the absolute appears as an inexhaustible infinity of possibilities, always offered to it and never exhausted—although the individual self is perpetually lacking with respect to them. Considered in itself, however, the absolute subject is pure act; no separate possibility resides within it. Possibilities intervene only when participation begins. Relative to the absolute self, the individual self is itself nothing but a possibility whose actualization—while it contributes its own efficacy—is itself left to the individual.

## 71. Creation
**The creation of the world is the creation of different consciousnesses.**

Creation is often taken to bear upon the universe of objects. Yet no object has meaning except for a subject, for a consciousness that perceives it outside itself albeit in relation to itself. Thus not only is there solidarity between the perceived object and the perceiving subject; there is also the primacy of the perceiving subject over the perceived object, which always expresses, within the whole of being, what limits the subject’s operation even as it completes and answers it. The creation of consciousnesses is therefore the very condition of the creation of the world of objects, and not the reverse—first because consciousnesses are beings for whom objects are phenomena, next because the world of objects is the means whereby different consciousnesses distinguish themselves from and yet communicate with one another. Creation is nothing other than an ever-offered participation. The infinite act does not suffice unto itself; its very nature is to give itself, and to give itself infinitely. For that gift to be the gift of itself—that is, of an act and not of a thing—it can only be the offer of a possibility each being actualizes, thus becoming, in the passage from possibility to actuality, the creator of itself: such is the very definition of a consciousness. The world expresses the conditions that must be gathered for this possibility to take shape; once they are present, taking possession of them and using them express, within participation, a reciprocal relation between the absolute of pure act and the absolute of our free act, the former grounding the latter and the latter implementing the former in and through us.

Virtuality itself has a threefold relation to the infinite. First, it is a determination of an infinite power; as Bergson emphasized in celebrated texts, such a determination is realized only retrospectively by reference to a real existence of which one had first to have experience. Yet the determined possibility is not the virtuality of that particular existence to the exclusion of every other. It is the virtuality of an infinity of similar existences that can be reproduced, though without being exactly identical, the virtuality providing only a kind of schema that must each time receive an individual and unique form according to the circumstances of time and place. Thus this infinitely available virtuality—an infinity, so to speak, of extension—must each time realize itself in a concrete individual bearing within itself an infinity of expansion: two inseparable and mutually compensating forms of infinity.
