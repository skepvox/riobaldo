## 1. Relation
**Consciousness must be defined by the internal relation among the psychological subject, the transcendental subject, and the absolute subject.**

The word subject is itself purely abstract; it designates nothing more than the centre with respect to which we consider the real taken as a whole. The psychological subject is the centre of an individual perspective; the transcendental subject is the centre of every perspective in general; the absolute subject is the centre without perspective—not the abstract centre of all particular perspectives, but the concrete centre that simultaneously abolishes and founds them. Where, then, is consciousness? Assuredly not with the isolated psychological subject who, taken to the limit, would be nothing but an epiphenomenon of the body—illuminated yet not illuminating, incapable of supplying its own light. Nor is it with the transcendental subject, often regarded as the logical subject whose mode of acting we know only through its products. Nor is it with the absolute subject which, when one tries to isolate it from the psychological and transcendental subjects, appears either identical with the thing in itself or as the object of an aspiration, an object of faith. Consciousness results, rather, from a circulation among these three aspects of the same subject. The psychological subject recognises its individuality at the very moment it perceives its limitation—that is, when the transcendental subject takes it as object and surpasses it—and the transcendental subject, in turn, can be defined only by the limitation proper to any perspective, the very limitation that constitutes it while obliging it to go beyond itself. In more elementary terms, consciousness always results from the living relation that is established in each of us among the individual, the human being (or, more accurately, finite being in general), and absolute being; it cannot be attributed to any one of the three save in its relation with the other two. Thus, on another plane, theological meditation has judged that it could ascribe spirituality to God Himself only by establishing the internal relation among the three persons.

## 2. Immediacy
**Precisely because the absolute subject has no perspective on the real, it stands in immediate relation only with the other subjects and not with objects.**

From proposition 1 we may infer that the absolute subject, once we consider it as both the foundation and the summit of the transcendental subject and of psychological subjects, can no longer, as they do, be the subject of a world made up of real objects—be they ideas or sensible things. Ideas and things appear only within the perspective of a subject in general or of a particular subject. By contrast, the absolute subject stands in immediate relation only with every centre of perspective that can exist with respect to the real, founding both their distinction and their agreement; ideas and things have meaning for it only through those perspectives, of which it is, properly speaking, the raison d'être. In creationist language one may thus say that God did not create ideas or things, but that in creating beings—that is, persons—He at once created the world of ideas, common to every consciousness, and the sensible world in which each consciousness expresses the original, irreducible vision it has of the world.

## 3. Dependence
**There is no purely psychological subject that does not derive from the transcendental subject the consciousness it has of itself.**

That there is no purely psychological subject can be shown by the very possibility, on the part of the transcendental subject, of considering the psychological subject as an object whenever the latter is reduced to its pure psychological essence. In that case—using the vocabulary now universally adopted—we say that the psychological subject ceases to be an “I” (je) and becomes a “me” (moi). It then no longer fulfils the function of psychological subject. Within it the transcendental subject performs the function of subject and enables the psychological subject not merely to know objects and its own states but, in a certain sense, to be conscious of itself. One may therefore say that the transcendental subject, without itself possessing self-consciousness, confers upon the psychological subject the consciousness it has of itself. Most remarkable here—and what shows the indivisibility of the three aspects of the subject—is that the psychological subject, in becoming an object of knowledge for the transcendental subject, is conscious of itself without knowing itself. Everything in the world that has meaning only for it and in relation to it—its own states no less than its perceptions insofar as they always include some qualitative and emotive resonance—can never be fully objectified.

## 4. Incarnation
**The transcendental subject makes sense only insofar as it incarnates itself within the psychological subject; it is from their encounter that consciousness is born.**

The preceding argument shows that the light that illuminates me comes from above. I am conscious of myself only because the transcendental subject allows me to posit myself as a psychological subject—or because there is within me a subject in general that allows me to recognise the “me” that I am. Yet the transcendental subject has no independent existence. At best it is the possibility of every particular “me,” the principle that enables each one to be determined to existence. That is why freedom is exercised in the relation between the transcendental “I” and the particular “me.” But this possible “me” can know itself only the moment it is actualized; this free “me” only the moment it determines itself. Thus there is no consciousness of the transcendental “I” except through its concrete relation with the psychological “me,” whose existence it grounds while ceaselessly calling it into question. Likewise the transcendental “I” enables the psychological “me” to think the idea beyond the perception it has of the sensible object. Consciousness thus appears as an enveloping of and a surpassing of the psychological “me” by the transcendental “I,” whereas, taken separately, the former would be comparable to an object devoid of thought and the latter to a thought without object.

## 5. Mediation
**The absolute subject can be called consciousness only through the relation it maintains—with the mediation of the transcendental subject—with the psychological subject.**

The transcendental subject cannot suffice unto itself; it is abstract. It is the possibility of the psychological subject, and only the absolute subject can bestow upon it its own possibility. The idea of a perspective on the real, common to all yet belonging to none in particular, is justified, as we saw in Book I (Prop. LV), only through the absolute subject, which is alien to every perspective while containing them all. Consciousness constantly seeks an immediate relation between individual and absolute, yet it cannot ignore the multiplicity of individual subjects. One may even suppose that a single subject cannot be posited without all the others being posited as well. We must therefore conceive the relations of each subject with all the others—but to do so we must discover them as subjects, which is possible only through the mediation of the subject in general, whose incarnation in beings other than myself is readily intelligible and thanks to which I can understand why the world in which I live is the very same world in which you live, even though neither of us perceives it in the same way.

## 6. Persistence
**Within the internal relation of the elements of the subject, the relation of the subject to the object persists at every level.**

One might think that, within the relation of the elements of the subject to one another, each of those elements can in turn be taken as an object for the other two, so that any relation to the object proper would vanish. In that way one would explain the complete interiority or perfect self-sufficiency of consciousness. Yet within each of the roles assigned to it the subject retains its relation with a privileged object; otherwise it would lose its very nature as subject and could not define its own function in distinction from the other two. The psychological subject does not take the transcendental subject as its object but, outside us, the sensible thing, and within us, the state of mind—without which it would not be a psychological subject at all. The transcendental subject does not fulfil its mediating role by taking as object either the psychological subject in which it is actualized or the absolute subject that would be the term of its aspiration. Its proper object is the idea—without which it could not secure agreement among psychological subjects within an experience that is the same for all and could not therefore discharge its function as transcendental subject. Finally, the absolute subject does not take the transcendental or the psychological subject as its object—doing so would suppose that they could in some sense be independent of it; properly speaking it has no object. It overcomes all exteriority: it contains and sustains both the transcendental and the psychological subject, which live only by the activity it lends them, even though they can, in order to acquire a life of their own, separate themselves from it while it never separates itself from them.

## 7. Distinction
**The relation among the psychological self, the transcendental self, and the absolute self is a purely spiritual distinction that entails no real separation comparable to that which space and time introduce among objects or events.**

Distinct terms can be conceived only by means of space and time, which establish a distance among objects and events. Such a distinction has meaning, therefore, only within the phenomenal world. When one considers the life of the subject, however, one may say that it is trans-phenomenal and consequently independent of space and time—the very media through which the subject furnishes itself with objects (one must even distinguish the world of ideas from the world of objects, for implication and exclusion obey laws different from those governing the separation and relation of places or moments as they are realized by spatial or temporal intervals, by movement or by the memory that overcomes them). Thus the absolute subject can never be really distinct from either the psychological or the transcendental subject, even though there may be a kind of veil between them. Yet that veil can never prevent the psychological subject, unbeknown to itself, from undergoing the action of the transcendental subject, nor the transcendental subject from receiving from the absolute subject the whole of the activity it possesses. Two consequences follow. First, there exists a spiritual world composed of the totality of the life of the subject, maintaining unity across the multiplicity of its modes, with the phenomenal world serving both as the means through which it manifests itself and the condition through which it is realized. From this we must conclude that there is only one absolute subject—and even only one transcendental subject. Although we are tempted to view the latter as inseparable from the multiplicity of psychological subjects in which it is incarnated, it nonetheless expresses the same relation between the absolute subject and each psychological subject; it must be one in order to unite them and to serve as their witness. There is not a plurality of identical reasons in each consciousness; every consciousness appeals to the same reason, in the strictest sense of the term, and none of them is ever fully adequate to it. Second, monadology is not entirely correct, for the psychological subjects are not completely separate and independent from one another. They are interior to themselves precisely insofar as, through the mediation of the transcendental subject, they bind themselves to the absolute subject; they thus discover the freedom that is their own absolute beginning, because it is a participation in that absolute beginning which is the proper act of the absolute subject. Yet this deepest interiority unites them with every other monad instead of separating them; they are separated only when, reduced to their condition as psychological subjects, they know nothing beyond their own limitation and the very servitude within which the body confines them.

## 8. Interval
**The real world fills the interval separating the different modalities of the subject.**

Up to this point we have not left the world of subjectivity. We have known nothing beyond the distinction among the different modalities of the subject and among the particular subjects we are obliged to differentiate—otherwise absolute and even transcendental subjectivity would not be distinct from psychological subjectivity. But the distinction among the different modes of subjectivity can be posited only through a gap that must be filled. It can be filled only by objectivity: the objectivity of the world of ideas fills the interval between absolute subjectivity and transcendental subjectivity, and the sensible world fills the interval between transcendental subjectivity and psychological subjectivity. That is also why (1) different consciousnesses are separated from one another and yet united, and (2) there exists, within the total subject, a regulated correspondence between idea and sensible reality.

## 9. Gradation
**The dialectic of consciousness can be described as a progressive gradation that moves from spontaneity to reflection and from reflection to creation.**

Consciousness first presents itself as spontaneity: it adheres to the real without distinguishing itself from it. It then becomes reflection, separating itself from the real in order to take possession of itself. Finally it attains creation, returning to the real in order to transform it according to the demands it draws from the absolute. These three moments are not mutually exclusive; they interpenetrate and sustain one another. Spontaneity prepares reflection, reflection prepares creation, and creation reinvigorates both spontaneity and reflection.

## 10. Value
**The idea becomes value as soon as it is willed.**

The idea expresses the activity of the absolute subject insofar as it can be participated in; it is participated in by the transcendental subject and descends as far as the sensible world, becoming, as it were, its reason. Yet we still remain at the level of intelligence—that is, possibility. The psychological subject can participate in the absolute through the mediation of the idea; the idea is then only a mediation toward the absolute. Once the idea is willed, however, it becomes an ideal, a realised participation rather than one merely thought; it becomes the object of love and rightfully bears the name value. The term is thus equivocal, for depending on whether it is oriented toward the sensible world, which it explains, or toward the absolute, to which it opens access, the same reality deserves the name idea or the name value. Two attitudes are possible: either the subject considers the idea as an intelligible object to which it applies itself, or it regards the idea as coming from higher than itself and as representing the very principle that animates it.

## 11. Participation
**The psychological subject constitutes itself as a participation in the absolute subject through the mediation of the transcendental subject.**

One might be tempted to think that only the psychological and absolute subjects possess a concrete and real character, so that the life of consciousness would seem to be an immediate participation of the one in the other. Why not, then, dispense with the transcendental subject, as psychologists or mystics willingly do? Because it plays a mediating role that cannot be neglected. There is no particular subject without there also being a plurality, indeed an infinity, of subjects. The particular being in general becomes the possibility of this or that particular being. This possibility is a real possibility which—by virtue of its very indetermination—places at the disposal of the particular subject the infinity of possibles that constitute a divided expression of the perfection of the absolute subject; in the relation of the transcendental subject to the psychological subject will therefore be realised that choice of possibles which marks the exercise of freedom; and finally, by rising to the transcendental subject the psychological subject, going beyond its limits, practises true disinterestedness, which, in its relations with other particular subjects, testifies to the relations they all maintain with the absolute.

## 12. Act
**The subject, insofar as it is subject, can be defined only as an act—and even as an act without passivity.**

The notion of subject evokes that of a substance destined to bear accidents or qualities. Here, however, the word is taken in another sense: it names the centre to which all the possible objects of our thought can be related. This is possible on one condition only: that this centre never itself becomes an object, even for another subject, for such objectification would instantly abolish its very nature as subject. Hence it is false, as has been claimed, that a transcendental reduction could make the subject an object for the transcendental “I”; the latter must be regarded as the very subjectivity of the psychological subject. We are often tempted to regard the subject as an objective centre of reference on the pretext that there are other centres in the world besides the one I occupy—but that makes no sense. A subject that is neither object nor datum, yet for which there are objects and data, is precisely what makes them possible, what ensures that there are terms that not only relate to it but can be presented or offered to it. This is what we properly call an act, and reflection shows that only one act can possess that subjectivity or interiority by virtue of which we must not say that things are in us, but only that they relate to us. This act will be an act without passivity: every passivity is what lies outside it and limits it, and with which it has a relation—as a correlate without which it cannot be posited, yet foreign to the operation that posits it.

## 13. Correlation
**Operation and datum are correlated at every level of subjectivity.**

Every operation of the subject calls for a datum that answers it. On the level of the psychological subject, the datum is the sensible thing or the state of mind; on the level of the transcendental subject, it is the idea; on the level of the absolute subject, it is the very act from which all data and all operations derive. The unity of consciousness is constituted by this correlation, which ensures that participation never breaks the unity of the world.

## 14. Unity
**The subject’s proper activity is not divided among the different aspects of the subject; it must be grasped as a living unity that determines at each moment the orientation of every movement it undertakes.**

Only by abstraction do we distinguish an activity proper to each of the three kinds of subject we have defined. There is but one activity, just as there is but one subject. We must try to seize that activity at the very point where it applies itself and that enables it to turn toward its psychological form in order to individualise itself, toward its transcendental form to constitute knowledge, or toward its absolute form to ascend to its source. Here, therefore, we encounter that double path of descent and ascent that characterises all the movements of consciousness. These internal movements are always accompanied by the outward movements through which consciousness turns toward some object exterior to it—a thing, an idea, a value, or another consciousness.

## 15. Reflection
**Reflective activity is identical with creative activity, though in the opposite direction.**

By creative activity we mean the absolute activity whose effect does not differ from its pure exercise and of which it may be said that it creates everything that is—creation being nothing more than that activity itself, inasmuch as it lets itself be participated in by particular freedoms to which the world provides both the limits that separate them and the means that allow them to communicate. The activity we call reflective therefore presupposes the absolute or creative activity without being heterogeneous to it: as the creative activity, once participated in, enters time and expresses itself through the impetus that carries us from the past toward the future, reflective activity reverses its direction, remonting its course, constantly opposing the possible to the real and seeking in the possible the raison d’être of the real—whether in order to explain it or to produce it.

## 16. Junction
**Activity and passivity meet both at the base and at the summit of consciousness.**

The individual subject, insofar as it still clings to nature, must be defined as a spontaneity which is itself an activity, yet an activity we undergo, so that activity and passivity are not distinct within it. The same is true in the most perfect exercise of our freedom: freedom is an activity at our disposal, whose initiative belongs to us, although the power it possesses is itself a received power. (The difference is that in the first case our activity, as it were, dissolves into our passivity, whereas in the second the reverse occurs.) The distinction between activity and passivity arises only in the interval—that is, in the relation between the transcendental subject and the individual subject—precisely where my freedom encounters within nature itself a resistance it tries to overcome and produces within sensibility the effects to which I henceforth remain subject.

## 17. Freedom
**The distinction among the three aspects of the self enables us to understand the exercise of freedom: freedom is situated at the level of the transcendental self and looks now toward the empirical self and now toward the absolute self.**

Freedom can exist only where there is an alternative; indeed, it is the alternative that defines it rather than the infinity of ends among which it might choose. The alternative has meaning only if it always obliges us to choose between the lower and the higher. For that reason freedom resides on the level of the transcendental self, which now looks toward the absolute subject and now toward the empirical subject. It never renounces either one: at times it constitutes the empirical self by looking toward the absolute self—in that case it elevates the world to the level of the absolute; at other times it thinks it can reach the absolute self by looking toward the empirical self—in that case it lowers the absolute to the level of the world. Moreover, the transcendental self exists only as a centre of possibilities, whether it thinks them or actualizes them, and this is precisely the function of freedom.

## 18. Possibilizing
**Reflection is the possibilizing of the real, yet this possibilizing enfolds all the real within a pure power that, once actualized, can assume two different forms—ideal and objective—which correspond to the two fundamental functions of consciousness: understanding and willing.**

Reflection, which calls everything real into question, converts the whole of the real into the possible so that the subject may gain a hold over it by actualizing it. People often suppose that this conversion immediately transforms the thing into an idea. That is not the case. Reflection is a pure power that envelops the entire real. When actualized as understanding it produces the idea; when actualized as will it produces the object. Understanding turns toward the possible in order to explain the real; willing turns toward the possible in order to produce the real. The agreement between idea and object is precarious for knowledge; only action can verify it by realizing it, which is why experimentation has a decisive value even in the theory of knowledge.

## 19. Possible
**The possible is a being of thought that stands midway between pure act and the reality that actualizes it.**

We ordinarily oppose the possible to the real or to existence. We must not oppose it to being, however. The possible is not nothing; it expresses a certain interiority of being which accounts for the real and for existence, even though it can itself be separated from them. Possibles always express an analysis of the totality of being which, by placing its disposition in our hands, allows us to actualize it and thereby base our own existence on participation. We tend to view the possible as an object, and, in a privileged way, as the object of understanding, even though that object exists only through the operation of understanding. Yet to the extent that the possible can be actualized, it represents a power of the will that mirrors, with respect to the possible, the relation the will maintains, with respect to understanding.

## 20. Presence
**The act of the mind differs from action in that, instead of producing a material effect, it produces only the pure presence of its object.**

It is difficult to define the act otherwise than by reference to its effect. Doing so, however, confuses it with action, which involves the body as much as the mind and establishes a relation between bodily movements and the movements it imposes upon other bodies. When we consider the act in its pure state, independently of the body, we naturally attribute to it the function of positing its object, in the sense that to posit it is to construct or even create it. This is how modern philosophy often speaks of the intention that actualizes objects by presenting them. The spiritual act does not imitate material action; it does not unfold in exteriority, and by giving things presence it does not break its own interiority.

## 21. Foundation
**The self occupies a position above the distinction between spectator and agent, even though it founds that distinction on the three planes of its activity.**

The self resides in activity, yet an activity that is not absolute and that splits necessarily into a creative activity by which it produces itself while imprinting the world with its mark, and a purely representative activity by which it embraces the world that exceeds it—thus remaining in solidarity with the whole of the world even while detaching itself from it. This activity and this passivity will reappear on the level of the individual self under the form of the opposition between sensation and desire, on the level of the transcendental self as the opposition between understanding and will, and in the absolute self within that unity that can be offered in participation only on condition of splitting itself in order to feed both our contemplation and our action.

## 22. Interiority
**Consciousness does not exclude the relation of interiority and exteriority, as is sometimes believed on the grounds that it holds only for space: as with every pair of contraries, interiority enjoys a privilege over exteriority and absorbs it at the limit.**

Some have objected [cf. Book I, Prop. LXXVI] to the idea of an inner world of consciousness alongside an outer physical world, arguing that such representation is valid only in space. Consciousness, they say, is not in space; it therefore has no interiority, and nothing is exterior to it in the strict sense. Yet the opposition between interiority and exteriority has here a different meaning: interiority is not an object located within an enclosure, but what has meaning in and for itself, whereas exteriority is what has meaning only for another, namely for a subject without which it would be nothing at all. For a finite subject interiority and exteriority are reciprocally related. Interiority nonetheless enjoys a privilege over exteriority, because the former is positive whereas the latter reflects only its limitation. Hence exteriority would disappear, absorbed by interiority, were the latter carried to its furthest limit. Conversely one might say, if by interiority one means not an act but a content, that the subject has no “within,” only a “without” with which it is ceaselessly in relation—the relation that constitutes its sole within.

## 23. Representation
**The subject creates the representation of the world both through what it is and through what it is not—hence the share of activity and the share of passivity that appear in its work.**

The representation we have of the world has almost always been explained through the opposition of matter and form, although no account can be given either of the existence of matter—which remains an unintelligible datum—or of the fittingness of form—in which the mind recognises its own operations—to a matter that is heterogeneous to it. Once we accept, however, that the subject’s activity is a participated activity, it is inseparable from the activity in which it participates. This means that participation never breaks the unity of the world. Such unity is possible on one condition only: the subject’s activity must always be correlated with a passivity that surpasses and answers it, or every operation it accomplishes must be correlated with a certain datum. The representation of the world expresses in the subject both what it is and what it is not, what it can and what it cannot—provided that what it is not or cannot is always related to what it is and can be. This is indeed what the distinction and correspondence constantly established within knowledge between its matter and its form show us.

## 24. Expression
**Freedom expresses the act through which the psychological subject participates in the absolute subject by way of the transcendental subject.**

Freedom is an activity at my disposal, a power I have received but can exercise only by seizing hold of it. It belongs solely to a particular subject. Within that subject, however, it is the power to create itself, to surpass itself, to go beyond whatever it already is. For that reason it must widen the particular subject to the dimensions of the subject in general, within which there exists the possibility of a multiplicity of different subjects, of an alteration and enrichment of my psychological nature. Put differently, the subject in general creates a mediation thanks to which the psychological subject, instead of remaining enclosed within its own limits, ceases to be imprisoned by them and goes beyond them without cease. Grafted onto nature, freedom is the power by which my nature is negated and ceaselessly transcended.

## 25. Antinomy
**Freedom is at once one and multiple: in order to exercise itself it gives rise to the antinomy of the one and the multiple and resolves it.**

Freedom can be defined only as the single power to choose among different possibles. To call it a power is to distinguish it from the activity in which it participates and which, as Descartes emphatically noted, can never be defined by its potentiality—potentiality being the very sign of impotence and insufficiency. In the absolute, power is immediately converted into act; it does not differ from act. Power, on the contrary, appears as the law of every participation. What is left to the particular being is precisely the initiative of converting this power into act. Ideally this power is the power of the whole, even though it is necessarily bounded by the conditions in which it is exercised, determined by the situation within which it is engaged and by the time within which it must act. The unity of this power is therefore correlated with an objective multiplicity that solicits within it different thoughts and offers it a host of possibles among which it must choose. In that choice the unity never breaks, for it expresses a hierarchy of possibles, and even those it excludes are excluded by its own act. The choice is, in a sense, the only way freedom has of creating and, consequently, of creating the self itself; here the distinction between creator and created cannot be abolished as it is in pure act—the relation between the two terms is constantly called into question. The multiplicity corresponds to the participated activity that, while preserving its inner unity, sets over against itself an infinitely varied world that becomes the very material of its decisions. Those decisions assume both the form of an option and that of a synthesis. The antinomy of the one and the multiple is the condition of freedom; it is also its work, for freedom supplies both the problem and the solution.
