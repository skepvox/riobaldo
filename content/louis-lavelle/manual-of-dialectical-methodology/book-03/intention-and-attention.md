## 50. Intentionality
**Consciousness must be defined by its intentionality rather than by its content.**

Contemporary philosophy has abandoned the classical language that spoke of the “content” of consciousness. The relation of container to contained has meaning only in space, and consciousness, which thinks space, cannot be spatialised. Consciousness is therefore intentional, and we must determine both the objects toward which its intention is directed and the manner in which they present themselves when they become present. Intentionality reinstates the correlation between operation and datum, resolves the quarrel between idealism and realism, and restores the role of finality: the act of consciousness is turned toward what it aims to know, to love, or to realise.

## 51. Particularity
**Particular intention is always tied to the psychological subject.**

Intention is always bound to a choice, to the determination of our activity toward a particular object that responds to an interest. The direction of intention presupposes an individual subject aware of what it lacks and turning toward it. Intention therefore belongs to psychological consciousness, which supplies the concrete ends toward which it is directed.

## 52. Truth
**Consciousness in general may be regarded as the intention of truth and of value.**

One can nonetheless speak of an intention proper to consciousness in general. In its purest form this intention is directed toward truth—toward objects of pure knowledge, toward ideas. These ideas remain present within psychological intention in order to allow it to recognise, within the sensible object, the idea that gives it meaning. In its relation with the absolute subject, consciousness appears also as the intention of value.

## 53. Temporality
**Intention unfolds within time; attention rises above time.**

Intention belongs to time, carries within it some impurity, and remains linked to interest. Attention, by contrast, is the pure act through which consciousness gathers itself, rises above time, and opens itself unreservedly to what is. Intention is an attention that has already entered time; attention is intention raised to its pure act.

## 54. Attention
**Attention is the initial and fundamental act of consciousness.**

Attention is the pure power through which consciousness disposes of itself. It is the ever-awake source from which intention derives. Before any particular choice, consciousness is attention—an act that allows intention to be oriented and particularised.

## 55. Surpassing
**Attention surpasses intention.**

Intention requires attention, yet attention surpasses intention. It is not bound to any determinate object; it is the pure capacity of turning the mind toward whatever deserves to be willed or known. Attention therefore carries us beyond every limited aim.

## 56. Reciprocity
**Attention and intention imply one another.**

If intention presupposes attention, attention in turn implies intention. The most profound intention is the one by which consciousness takes itself as its own object—without transforming itself into an object. Attention to our intention and intention of our attention constitute the knot where the transcendental and the psychological selves join.

## 57. Interiority
**Interiority and exteriority are reconciled within attention.**

Attention does not abolish the relation of interior to exterior. Rather, it renders the mind present to what is exterior without ceasing to inhabit itself. Through attention the subject discovers that its true interiority lies in the relations it establishes with what is other than itself.

## 58. Relations
**Attention reveals the network of relations that unites the subject to the world.**

To attend is to discern relations. Attention enables us to perceive how each datum stands in relation to the subject and to the universe. It therefore brings to light the structure of participation.

## 59. Act
**Attention is an act without passivity.**

Attention is not a state but a pure act. Nothing passive remains in it. It is an act without effect distinct from itself, whose efficacy lies in the very illumination it provides.

## 60. Operation
**Attention is the operation that makes every other operation possible.**

Every operation of the mind presupposes attention. Without it there would be no perception, no judgment, no decision. Attention is the operation that opens the way to all other operations by making their objects present.

## 61. Freedom
**Attention is the highest expression of freedom.**

Only attention is entirely at our disposal. By means of it we can at every moment begin again, orient our intention differently, and engage our activity in a new direction. Attention is therefore the purest act of freedom.

## 62. Assumption
**Attention assumes and transfigures intention.**

Attention does not abolish intention; it takes it up and transfigures it. By elevating intention above its particular object, attention restores it to its source and renders it available for higher ends.

## 63. Double Sense
**Intention and attention constitute the double sense of consciousness.**

Consciousness possesses a double orientation: outward through intention, inward through attention. Intention turns toward the object to be known, desired, or realised; attention returns toward the subject that acts. The dialectic of these two moments defines the very movement of consciousness.
