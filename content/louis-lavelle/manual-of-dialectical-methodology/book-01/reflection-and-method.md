## 1. Unity
**There is only one philosophy, though it shows different aspects.**

There is only one philosophy just as there is only one world. And just as there are different perspectives on the same world, there are also different aspects of philosophy, in which the personality of each philosopher is expressed. Yet philosophy strives to understand them and to go beyond them. It is at once knowledge and wisdom: knowledge of being, on which a wisdom of conduct is founded. It seeks to give the meaning of the universe both to the intelligence that contemplates it and to the will that acts within it. This undertaking must be valid for all people and not just for one alone: for all people are like a single person whose thoughts become actual in different consciousnesses, not merely in the abstract because they are subject to the same laws, but in fact because those same thoughts become actual in different consciousnesses where they harmonize and clash as in his own. Thus no philosophy can be valid for me unless it is valid for all; and if the application I make of it must vary according to my original situation in the world, it is to confirm my truth and not to contradict it.

## 2. Truth
**Philosophy demands a truth that can be satisfied only by an intellectual experience.**

Likewise, philosophy cannot be content with expressing the wishes of sensibility, which are often confused and uncertain, carry a kind of mortgage on the future, and risk disappointing us even when they are fulfilled. It must establish me in the truth of myself and of the world, a truth that compels my assent and the assent of everyone, that governs my desires instead of answering them. It must therefore have a character of necessity. This necessity is not inevitably that of reasoning, although reasoning confirms and makes it explicit; it is a more primordial and more profound necessity, that of an experience that is always available and from which it is impossible to escape. This experience is not immediate: it must always be recovered and deepened. That is the task of the philosopher, who ceaselessly proposes it to others so that they may obtain it in turn. No one possesses it who cannot lose it. But it can be common to all and impose itself on each only because it is a true experience. Now the experience of truth can only be an intellectual experience. There is no philosophy other than intellectualism.

## 3. Method
**Method lies in a conduct of the intelligence.**

Philosophy therefore resides in a certain action of the intelligence. The point is not to seek to know the intelligence, since it is the intelligence itself that would have to know it. To know the intelligence is only to exercise it. But it does not exercise itself alone. Or rather, it tends toward an object that it seeks to acquire in a kind of possession; yet it gives that object such transparency that it seems to dissolve into it, and its presence to all of reality becomes in the end its own presence to itself. It is as with light, which begins by illuminating the darkness of the world and which, one now wonders, might also be its very substance. Hence philosophy always seems to consist in a direction of the intelligence, that is, in a certain method; and that method itself seems to merge with the doctrine, as the example of all the great philosophies shows. Philosophy depends on an operation of attention that must be constantly renewed and which, provided it takes place as it should, will reveal to us the very being that we are and its insertion into the whole of Being, from which it is at once separate and inseparable.

## 4. Subjectivity
**The philosophical method seeks in subjectivity the reason for objectivity.**

But how am I to exercise my attention? What direction must I give it? The world before my eyes reveals the presence of a world whose limits I do not know, within which is situated a body that I call my own, which is distinct from it and yet always remains in relation with it. As soon as my attention applies itself to this world, it constitutes science, which is the work of the intelligence. But what philosophy seeks is precisely the meaning of this world I see before me, and of which one may say that its mystery grows as I know it better. That meaning is invisible; it depends solely on my thought; it exists only within me, in an act that it is up to me to accomplish and that always retains an irreducible character of subjectivity. Subjectivity here is not that of my states of mind, which always remain subordinate to the body; it is that of the mind itself insofar as it is able to give meaning to all things, including my states of mind themselves. Philosophy always seeks in subjectivity the reason for objectivity.

## 5. Reflection
**Reflection is the intellectual movement by which the subject grounds in its effective experience of itself the possibility of every experience, external or internal.**

A moment ago we were dealing with an intelligence that was trying to reach an object and even to make the totality of being an object for itself. Now it must turn away from the object as it is given in an external experience in order to look for an inner experience that can ground that object and give it its meaning. What will this experience in turn concern? Will it concern some secret object that would exist only for us alone? But such an experience would obviously be no more instructive than the first; it would be incapable of giving us meaning, that is to say of justifying itself as well as the experience we had abandoned. It can only be the experience of subjectivity itself, defined as the condition without which no experience, either external or internal, would be possible for us. This is not merely the statement of a formal and purely logical condition without which no experience would appear to me as possible, but a real experience, which is not the experience of a new object but that which the subject takes of itself, that is, of its own subjective action, insofar as it supports every experience it can call its own. This movement by which the intelligence, instead of looking forward toward the object of its experience, looks back toward the subject of that experience is what one calls reflection.

## 6. Absolute
**The absolute subject is the condition of the subject in general, of the individual subject, and of their agreement.**

This subject itself cannot be confused with the intelligence, even though the intelligence is supported by it—albeit in a very different way than the experience of which it was itself the centre. For this intelligence, though always exercised by me, is in me precisely that by which I know myself, situate myself, and surpass myself. Thus it does not content itself with discovering the subject of experience; it seeks its meaning. There are many features in the subject that escape it and that it seeks to deepen: this subject reveals to it its limitation so long as it is still only a psychological subject and the centre of a perspective that belongs to it alone. Such a subject is only the determination of the subject in general, set within it in a concrete form, but it is the condition of possibility not merely of this or that experience but of any experience whatsoever. Yet even that cannot satisfy us; for the question remains of knowing why there are thus different subjects that can become the centre not only of an individual perspective but of any perspective at all. This leads me to posit an absolute subject that is not only the condition for the existence of the subject in general, just as the subject in general was the condition for the individual subject and the individual subject was the subject of my concrete, objective, and subjective experience, but the condition for the subject in general, for the individual subject, and for their agreement all at once.

## 7. Experience
**There is an experience of the absolute subject just as there is an experience of the subject in general and an experience of the psychological subject.**

One must not say that such a subject is the object of no experience. Philosophy has always suffered from the narrow sense of the word experience, which one wanted to apply only to sense knowledge of the material object, or at best to our states of mind. Yet there is an experience of the psychological subject: without it I could not say "I," nor even say "my body," since my body would not be distinguished from any other object and those objects would be posited as objects without my being able to say that it is I who perceive them. Likewise there is an experience of the subject in general, always associated with the individual subject, which, so to speak, fills it with its particular experiences; but without such an experience I could neither regard myself as a true subject—that is, as a possibility that the actions of my freedom and the events of my life never cease to determine—nor enter into relation with other subjects that exist as I do, though with other determinations. Finally, there is an experience of the absolute subject, with which I feel myself always linked yet always unequal, with respect to which my very activity is always received, which never ceases to provide for me, and to which I remain constantly present in order to be present to myself. There is here a passivity that can be said to be the inverse of external experience, for the latter draws me ceaselessly outside myself, whereas the former increases without cease my intimacy with myself.

## 8. Analysis
**The true philosophical method consists in the analysis, by the self, of a total experience of which it is part.**

Let no one say that such an experience is impossible and that it is the very nature of the self to remain always confined within its own limits. That is not true. On the contrary, the greatest difficulty for the intelligence is to fix the very limits of the self: they are doubtless singularly mobile. The distinctive feature of the experience of the self is that it constantly puts it in relation with things that are different from it—with its body, and through that body with bodies that are not its own, with ideas that one may say it thinks but that are not it, with an activity that surpasses it and that it undergoes even as it exercises it. Thus there are very different kinds of experience; but they all share the same feature: they put the self in relation with a whole of which it is part, which opposes itself to it yet in which it inscribes itself, which ceaselessly nourishes it rather than limits it. The most subtle of these experiences is that of the relation between my own act and the very act that grounds it, and which one too often thinks that, if it is external to me, it is nothing more than a thing or a hypothesis that I do not verify. It is a bit as though I maintained that I have nothing more than the experience of my body and cannot have the experience of the world. But just as I grasp my body only within the world, so I grasp my own act only in its relation with an act that is present to me, in which I always participate imperfectly and which is not mine, even though it is from it that I hold the very power I have to act and to make my own every kind of experience, even the experience I have of it in its relations with what I am. This is doubtless the highest experience I can have, beyond which I do not rise; it constitutes the summit and the heart of metaphysics; it is up to us never to forget it. All particular experiences derive from it; it is their keystone. Thus philosophy itself reveals to us its true method, which is the analysis of the totality of experience and of the relations that unite its different kinds to one another.

## 9. Order
**Through reflection we grasp the activity of our mind; through method we put it to work so as to establish order in our thoughts and in our actions.**

Such is the summit to which reflection can rise. After that one must descend again, that is, think and live. Here method intervenes. Its role, so to speak, is to make use of time instead of undergoing it, to substitute for the order of events that is imposed on us in spite of ourselves an order that is chosen and willed, through which the inner demands of our consciousness are marked, but also our original intervention in the world, that is, our very existence in its relation with the world, inasmuch as our existence is nothing if it is not capable of understanding and modifying it. Time is therefore the instrument both of our enslavement and of our liberation. It is true that, in order to assert its independence, the self might be content to disturb the order of the world by sudden, disconnected irruptions. That is what one observes in a freedom that tries to give proof of itself through negative gestures by which it bears witness in the world against the world itself. But between these discontinuous irruptions it renounces itself; or else it must find itself again even within the relation that unites them. Even if it thinks it triumphs over the world at that point and in the instant when it acts—which never happens—it is the world itself that triumphs over it at every other point and in every other instant. Method is therefore the only means we have, on the one hand, of securing for our mind a continuous application, that is, of making it master of itself, and of enabling it, on the other hand, at least potentially, to equal, as Descartes clearly saw, the totality of the world. One will note that method is at once intellectual and volitional, that it establishes an order among our thoughts, but that this order among our thoughts cannot be separated from an order among our actions—subject, however, to the reservation that method is not intended to recreate the world either by thought or by action, but to respond to the solicitations of events, that is, to solve the problems posed to us by the very circumstances in which we are placed, according to certain rules that are always at our disposal. Finally, it should be observed that if the proper function of reflection is to place us before a first term where we take, so to speak, possession of the activity of our mind, the proper function of method is to set it to work in such a way that it may engender knowledge and guide conduct. Hence, paradoxical though it may seem, if reflection is an ascending movement of the mind destined to establish us in the source of thought itself, method is a descending movement in which that thought itself answers all the problems that existence puts to it.

## 10. Light
**What is deepest within us is not the darkest point but the brightest point.**

It is a great mistake to think that what is deepest within us, the point where our own being is inserted into the absolute being, is also the darkest point, like a kind of black sun from which all the light that illuminates us would radiate. What is deepest within us is not that ultimate problem that forever recedes and that we never succeed in formulating; it is that perfectly simple and indivisible point that nevertheless fills everything, according to Pascal’s phrase, whose presence is found everywhere and lends a kind of transparency to what is, and that reveals itself to us only in certain fleeting instants that we try in vain to hold on to. We always go from what is more illuminated to what is less so and from the summit of consciousness to all the penumbra that surrounds it. That was the meaning of Descartes’s démarche in the Cogito. We have no other resource than to begin it again constantly.

## 11. Consciousness
**Philosophy makes us aware of the subjective aspect of knowledge, which almost always gets absorbed in the objectivity of what is known.**

In the act of knowledge, the interest of the mind always attaches itself to the known object in which this activity is absorbed and disappears. It is this activity that constitutes the subject, and it is what philosophy undertakes to seize. It can reach it only through an analysis of a particular kind that, instead of distinguishing elements within the same object, traces the conditioned back to the condition, without there being homogeneity between these two terms, and in such a way that the condition not only cannot be detached from what is conditioned but is identical with the very act that posits it.

## 12. Return
**Every philosophy marks a return to the subject, who discovers himself through an act that is always the same and always new—that is to say, always renewed.**

That philosophy is always a return to the subject becomes clear enough both in one’s own philosophical experience and in the experience of all philosophers, for whom the point is less to rebuild the world than to reach that very activity by which the subject produces its own knowledge of the world and the insertion of its own will into the world. This return is always the same: it is the oldest discovery, yet one that must begin anew at every moment, not only because no one can make it in my place, but also because I cannot even make it once and for all myself, for I must rather regenerate it in each of the particular operations by which I pose a new philosophical problem for myself.

## 13. Resumption
**Reflection endlessly takes back into its hands the very activity from which it proceeds.**

Reflection is the origin of the consciousness we have of ourselves and of the world. There is no spontaneous consciousness. Spontaneity does not need consciousness. All consciousness is a taking possession of oneself and of all reality that presupposes an activity and, so to speak, turns it back toward itself in order to apprehend it. That this turning back, that this division produces consciousness is perhaps the true mystery of being. Yet if it is contradictory to imagine an activity that would not itself be an activity of the mind, and if it is impossible to imagine the mind without consciousness, reflection is less constitutive of consciousness than it is of our own consciousness. Our consciousness is therefore a derivation of the creative act, insofar as that act becomes our own act in the process of reflection. This process is always only a process of participation; it has as its counterpart in the creative activity a determinate form of spontaneity that we manage to set apart as the very correlate of the reflective operation, which posits it as its own antecedent in order to win it and to surpass it.

## 14. Disposition
**Reflection may be viewed as arising from an obstacle, but that obstacle is never more than an occasion: reflection is a permanent disposition of consciousness to which the obstacle, by limiting it, gives a particular application.**

The very word reflection invites us to view reflection as a derivation of primitive spontaneity at the moment when it rebounds against an obstacle. In fact, that is how one may describe the historical genesis of reflection. But such a description does not allow us to conceive its true nature. For if one limited oneself to it, reflection would appear as a purely mechanical phenomenon. Yet the obstacle does not necessarily produce reflection, and it sometimes seems to arise of itself, without any obstacle being discernible. The obstacle is an occasion that can bring it forth, that arouses it whenever it is applied to a particular problem. Nevertheless, reflection is the act by which freedom discovers itself and constitutes itself. In its most perfect form it is a sort of permanent operation of the self, always awake, folded back upon its own power; and it must be said of the obstacle not even that it startles it but that it directs its application.

## 15. Source
**Reflection is a return to the common source of understanding and willing.**

Strictly speaking one does not reflect on things but on that very activity which knows things or modifies them. It is that activity that reflection tries to seize in order to justify it and to regulate its course: it surpasses the opposition of understanding and will, which are distinguished only by the object to which they are applied and not by their pure exercise. Reflection finds the activity of the mind at its very source, before it has been divided in participation so as to allow finite being to contemplate a world it has not created or to transform it according to its power. It establishes this division of the faculties, which is the very law of consciousness; it sets them in communication; it obliges them to determine themselves by the same reasons.

## 16. Transformation
**Reflection changes the state of consciousness by endeavouring to explain it.**

Reflection is the characteristic act of consciousness: one may well say that it already presupposes consciousness, but it itself belongs to consciousness. It is the act of consciousness insofar as the latter deepens itself. It is vain to try to distinguish between spontaneous consciousness and reflective consciousness. For in its most elementary act consciousness is already reflective consciousness. Yet if consciousness is always stretched between the act it performs and the object to which that act applies, in its initial movement consciousness pays attention only to the relation of the act with its object, whereas in a second movement reflection considers rather the relation of the object with the act that applies itself to it. The relation is the same, but the emphasis is not placed on the same term. That is enough for one to think that reflection modifies consciousness; but this modification remains internal to it: it is consciousness explaining itself to itself instead of becoming absorbed in the effect of its operation.

## 17. Promotion
**Reflection does not interrupt life; it spiritualizes and advances it.**

If it is evident that reflection cannot be opposed to consciousness, and if it is merely the deepening of consciousness, people generally agree in opposing it to life, for life is a spontaneity that the very function of reflection would be precisely to interrupt. But this observation requires many qualifications. Reflection comes from life, and it is itself a form of life: it is a misuse of reflection to turn it against life. That is to view life itself in its crudest movement and reflection in a state of isolation in which it seems to push spontaneity away, whereas it illuminates its point. Not only can reflection not be detached from life, but it is carried by life itself, to which it gives a spiritual character and which it never ceases to refine and to advance.

## 18. Detachment
**Reflection detaches itself from the world only so as to take charge of the world while remaining itself outside the world.**

Reflection does not detach itself either from consciousness or from life, which are both modes of the activity of which reflection is doubtless a more personal and purer use. But if the world is a spectacle, reflection has no place within the world. One must even say that it detaches itself from it and remains itself outside the world, even though it always stays in relation with the world. It is precisely so that this world can be taken up by reflection, so that it may justify the world either by an act of the intelligence that discovers its reason or by an act of the will that takes it as matter and modifies it in such a way that value may be incarnated in it.

## 19. Totality
**Reflection encompasses the totality of the real.**

There is no object, real or possible, that cannot become an object for reflection. Reflection is a questioning of everything determinate in the world, of everything that is realized. Consequently it is a return toward an indeterminate activity and toward a principle of realization that must possess a character of unity, contain within itself both the potentiality and the reason of everything that can be, and at the same time found the very unity of the real and the relations we can establish among all its parts. Reflection is a possibilizing of the real that encloses within itself its relational unity.

## 20. Interiority
**Reflection separates us from the phenomenon in order to make us interior to what is.**

When it is said that reflection separates us from the world, this is to the extent that the world can itself be considered as a set of objects, that is, of phenomena. But it separates us from it only in order to make us know the being of that phenomenon. Now reflection itself belongs to being, in the sense that there is nothing outside being and that, consequently, there is a being of reflection just as there is a being of the phenomenon itself; but above all in another, much deeper sense, namely that as an activity it is not itself a phenomenon but a power of self-realization—which is the essential feature of being itself, from which it differs only in this respect: instead of being an absolute activity, it presupposes a given that it has not itself posited and participates in that activity without ever succeeding in equalling it.
