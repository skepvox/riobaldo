## 26. Pursuit
**Method is at once a pursuit and a path whose terminus is discovery.**

We must never forget that method is simultaneously a pursuit and a path.

If it is a pursuit, it presupposes an end, and that end must be known. Different methods may correspond to the end one first chooses. One may, in particular, distinguish within it theoretical ends and practical ends. Yet those practical ends must themselves be known if they are to be attained, so that they are enveloped in theoretical ends: it is the very function of method to seek them out. But they already presuppose an act that has chosen them—that is, a certain movement of freedom. Method is the work of freedom.

At the same time method is a path. Calling it a path implies (1) that we are far from the goal and, living in time, must traverse the interval that separates us from it; (2) that our mind is engaged with the real in a certain manner, so that there is an order of events imposed upon it by the nature of things—the temporal order, which expresses the mind’s own limitation; it cannot escape this order, even though it seeks to introduce within it a new order issuing from the mind, one that grounds the order of events instead of abolishing it; and (3) that every end is reached only through a succession of intermediaries, so that method may be defined as a theory of intermediaries or mediations.

These mediations necessarily depend on the subject’s original situation, on the end it proposes to attain, and on the indivisible solidarity that unites the parts of the real with one another and the mind with the real. These intermediaries are not necessarily deducible one from another—something that occurs only within the logical order, an order that cannot be taken as valid for every domain; it answers to an aim different from the causal order, or the historical order, or the order of preference. We must therefore insist on the plurality of kinds of order and seek to establish among them a synoptic correlation.

From what has been said we may infer that, in spite of Descartes’s thesis, one cannot imagine anything other than particular methods. Each depends upon the perspective adopted by the subject and the end it seeks to reach. Method is therefore the work of the human being and, as we shall soon see, takes as its starting point not the human being as such but the subject in whom the human being tries to define itself precisely through the exercise of method.

## 27. Plurality
**Method is not, as is often believed, a single instrument at the disposal of the mind for successively recovering every term of reality in accordance with a rule.**

People usually imagine that there is only one method, and that it therefore allows us to recover every aspect of the real according to a regulated order and to establish a regulated order among them. There is a contradiction in such an undertaking, however. It would amount to determining the order that reigns within the real—or the order according to which the real was produced—independently of any reference to the subject’s situation or to the project it has adopted, that is, independently of the two very conditions that allow method to be defined as such. All we can say is that, to a certain extent, one can establish connections among different methods, according to the different perspectives assumed by consciousness and the different ends it proposes to attain.

## 28. Starting Point
**Method must posit a first term that is not distinct from the subject, but the subject itself considered in the internal relation of its elements to one another and in its relation with any object whatsoever.**

The most important thing in the definition of method is its point of departure. That point can reside only in the term to which reflection leads—that is, the subject considered as an activity capable of positing by itself any object whatsoever. That object is itself correlated with some end the subject seeks to attain, and the end will in turn be conditioned by its relation with the different aspects of the subject, by the predominance of one or the other, and by the connection that unites them. Method must therefore oblige us, so long as we remain within the domain of the psychological subject, to seek in the sensible object the end of desire; then, once the psychological subject has come under the rule of the transcendental subject, to subordinate that sensible object to a rational object; and finally, once the transcendental subject discovers its own limitation in relation to the absolute subject, to subordinate that rational object to value. For the proper role of the transcendental subject is to posit its universality only within the idea, whereas the absolute subject proposes to the psychological subject, within value, something it can will and love. The subject is therefore the centre with respect to which every problem is raised and every discovery obtained, both in its specific character and in its order of subordination.

## 29. Analysis
**Method is an analysis of the subject and of all its implications.**

We may say of method as a whole not only that it takes the subject as its point of departure but that it consists in an analysis of the subject considered in its own nature and in the implications that nature entails. It is precisely the three aspects of the subject that allow us to distinguish different domains of being and to establish among them an order of subordination. This belongs to method—even though method and doctrine are closely connected—if we are interested not in the content specific to those domains but in the procedures by which we move toward them.

## 30. Mean
**This is not to say that the human being is “the measure of all things”, for as human the individual occupies a middle position-between a reality it subordinates (and that has meaning only in relation to it) and a reality to which it is subordinated, which gives it meaning.**

We cannot claim to return here to the ancient formula declaring that “the human being is the measure of all things.” Where does the human being figure in all this, except in the play of the subject’s different powers? The human being creates or determines itself within the subject, without being identifiable with the subject. Within the subject we distinguish powers that, left to themselves, are infra-human—those belonging to the individual subject—and other powers that, if they were granted separate existence, would be supra-human; finally there are powers such as those designated by the expression transcendental subject which would indeed define the human being were they not themselves unreal and abstract so long as they remain dissociated from the other two and characterise finite being in general rather than the properly human being [cf. Book I, Prop. LX and LXXXI]. The starting point of method is therefore the human being—not considered as an absolute, but as a being that subordinates the sensible and subordinates itself to the absolute.

## 31. Order
**Method must follow an order; without it each problem would be connected directly with the unity of the subject rather than with the other problems, and reflection would run the risk of endless repetition without ever being sure of being exhaustive.**

One may view the reflective movement as the indispensable preliminary to method, for within its triple relation with the psychological, transcendental, and absolute selves every particular problem finds its explanation: in the sensible order that expresses its relation with the psychological subject, in the intelligible order that expresses its relation with the subject in general, and in the order of value that expresses its relation with the absolute subject. Yet particular problems must also relate to one another; otherwise they would fail to find a place within the total unity of consciousness. We would risk encountering them always as new problems without ever being certain of having a guiding thread that allows us to cover, in succession, every region of the field of reflection.

## 32. Triple
**There are three possible orders: the order of inclusion, the order of composition, and the order of complementarity.**

Classically one may conceive three sorts of order among the different terms of knowledge:

1. The order of inclusion, in which the terms are arranged according to increasing complexity and decreasing generality; the order is at once ascending and descending. The passage from one term to another occurs by way of a middle term whose probative force is manifested in two ways: either, being included in the first and including the second, it allows the second to be included in the first (the order of extension); or, being included in the second and including the first, it allows the first to be included in the second (the order of comprehension). In the latter case the middle term is not a mere intermediary; it is a reason for being.
2. The order of composition, which, instead of proceeding from the general to the particular, goes from the simple to the complex. It involves two different movements, comparable to the inverse orders of extension and comprehension: we may depart from the complex in order to reduce it to the simple, or begin with the simple in order to construct the complex. Such is the meaning of analysis and synthesis.
3. Finally there is what we may call the order of complementarity, whereby the poorest notion calls for what it lacks so as to be completed. Historically this third sort of order has taken a particular form: to derive the richer from the poorer while allowing method to retain its fecundity, the richer must not be presupposed but engendered. One accordingly imagines a negative movement inseparable from the simple affirmation of the poorer, a movement in which the poorer is denied not in what it possesses but in what it lacks. Remaining faithful to negation—the sole procedure depending exclusively on the mind—and then denying negation in turn yields a new affirmation that restores the first affirmation while enriching it indefinitely.

## 33. Inclusion
**The order of inclusion should not be despised, yet it rests on a system of definitions and has an exclusively logical scope.**

The order of inclusion does not deserve the reproaches often addressed to it, for it establishes a systematic order among all our definitions and allows us to articulate them with one another. It cannot, however, be considered a properly metaphysical method—one that discloses the actual order among things, the place and significance of each within the totality of the real rather than merely within the play of conventions by which we assign each an extension and a comprehension. Furthermore, the most general genus and the individual considered in its singularity elude it equally. The most serious objection we can level against it is that the subject disappears or is itself posited as an object enjoying no privilege within the scale of concepts.

## 34. Composition
**The order of composition avoids the drawbacks of the order of inclusion but has an exclusively mathematical scope.**

The order of composition seeks to avoid what is so often viewed as the insurmountable pitfall of the order of inclusion—its sterility. Instead of teaching us to recognise the relations among definitions already posited, it teaches us to posit them within the very relations that unite them. We may therefore regard it as dynamic, in contrast to the static character of the preceding method. Such is at least the aspect it presents in its synthetic form, which proceeds by constructing concepts but is simply the reverse of its analytic form—the more fecund one, which allows us to resolve every problem by reducing the more complex to the simpler. The synthesis is more illusory than it appears, for one may ask on what principle we would construct one combination rather than another starting from what is simple. Unlike the order of inclusion, the subject does not here situate itself within the order of concepts; it is immanent to that order, which is nothing other than the Cogito in action. Apart from the difficulty of determining what counts as simple—for it is not the Cogito itself but the indecomposable terms it posits prior to all others and which enter into their composition—we may say that the order described here is an order of fabrication admirably suited to mathematics and borrowed from that science, yet always extremely difficult to apply not so much to physics (for physics can to some extent be reduced to mathematics) as to quality, which we are constrained to treat as an illusion, to the psychological, aesthetic, moral, and even metaphysical orders. What Descartes fails to recognise—or at least does not sufficiently stress—is that the subject’s activity is an activity of participation and not, as he believed, an activity that seeks to recover creative activity, to render itself all-powerful like it, and, at least in the abstract, to imitate it in its own fashion.

## 35. Complementarity
**The order of complementarity extends over a wider domain than the order of composition and does indeed exhibit a synthetic character, yet it lacks a genuinely dialectical scope.**

The order of complementarity avoids some of the dangers of the order of composition. It is not merely an order of fabrication, for it is not imposed by the mind upon the real; it translates the very process through which the real constitutes itself. In this sense it is more genuinely genetic than the order of composition; it would not accept being inverted in order to reveal the analytic order which constituted the point of arrival and raison d’être of the order of composition. Unlike the order of composition, where the mind is present in the concatenation of terms while remaining independent of them—in the sense that, though it crafts them, it receives no enrichment from them—here the mind advances with the real and undertakes the same ascent. Yet the mind is now naturalised, whereas it was not in the order of composition; in a certain sense it becomes confused with its object. Hence the familiar questions: (1) is the abstract posited from the outset as a logical condition of applying the method rather than an ontological or historical demand? (2) Does the meaning of this development truly express an immanent necessity, or is it rediscovered—retroactively, as it were—by employing elements borrowed from history among which arbitrary articulations are then established? (3) Is the role assigned to negation—so favourable to a description in which the order of things appears as a succession of phases whose rhythm comes to possess the necessity of a spoken cadence—not introduced as a reminder of an ever-present infinity that cannot be forgotten and that, rather than being actualized in a development it would ceaselessly revive, should instead be analysed? The apparent positivity of negation is nothing but the positivity of a pure affirmation, all the particular affirmations expressing—without recourse to the artifice of negation—the diversity of aspects that remain mutually supportive. Negation plays here a role comparable to the one it plays in the theory of reflection—that is, at the threshold of the order of composition as defined by Descartes: he locks it, as it were, at the beginning of the inquiry in order to discover the autonomous activity of the thinking subject; Hegel reintroduces it at each stage of the inquiry to enable progress. Negation is, generally speaking, an eminently methodological instrument whose use depends on an act of will, whereas affirmation always presupposes the subject’s application to the real, a complicity with it. Nevertheless this method lacks a truly dialectical character if the dialectical method, instead of enveloping every form of being within a logical necessitarianism, situates itself at the very heart of the subject—that is, within the exercise of its freedom—in order to relate it to every aspect of the universe that conditions it or that it in turn determines. The superiority of the order of complementarity over all others lies in the fact that it alone can set in motion an internal power of realization; yet it may be contradictory to set it in motion within a purely logical time. Every creation ex nihilo is atemporal, and the world as it exists for us can be constituted only at the level of participation.

## 36. Progression
**What these three methods share is that they proceed from the minimum of being to the maximum of being.**

All three methods aim to show how every mode of the real may be arranged between a minimum and a maximum of being. In this way we grant ourselves the illusion of passing from nothingness to being—the supreme act of creation—or of approaching it to the extent that our powers allow. In the order of inclusion—where the whole appears to be presupposed by the logical movement that analyses it—this genesis is purely ideal. In the order of composition it is still ideal, yet it seeks to coincide with real genesis and allows us to act upon it so as to bend its course. In the order of complementarity the demands of reason and the demands of being can no longer be distinguished; the two orders coincide. By means of a continuous progress all three legislate on behalf of a subject that endeavours to recover the order existing within the real, the order that would subsist were the subject itself to disappear—or, what amounts to the same, were it to be transformed into a subject without any link to the psychological subject, whether because the transcendental subject is exalted to the absolute or because the absolute subject breaks off every relation with the transcendental subject.

## 37. Dialectic
**The distinctive character of the dialectical method is that it sets out from consciousness itself, considered in the internal play that constitutes the condition of possibility of everything we can know.**

Reflection has shown us—as it showed Descartes—that we must return to the subject in order to account for the given; not that the given is abolished, but it receives its meaning only through its relation with the subject. Starting from this subject, we now endeavour to derive the different aspects of the given, not simply to posit them anew as they were initially presented to us, but to posit their meaning now that we know how they can be posited. The very idea of positing, as shown in Proposition XLV of Book I, is ambiguous: we may posit the entire real while assuming that it precedes the act that posits it—even though that act may influence the manner in which it presents itself to our thought—in which case we posit it as spectacle; or we may posit it as if the act that posits it created it. This allows us to oppose idealism and realism. We have no prejudice in this respect, and we may distinguish within the subject, where appropriate, different modes of positing the real, as though it disposed simultaneously of a spectacular activity and of a creative activity. For we know that the subject is not simple; it is precisely because it is not simple that it suffices to sustain the infinite diversity of aspects of the real, and the function of method is to show the correlation they may entertain with it.

## 38. Particularity
**There are only particular problems, all of which are posed by the experience of life; they can be solved only by defining their relation to the other elements of experience.**

One must say—not of the world, which ever calls for thought, but of being as a whole—that it cannot be considered a problem. It is, so to speak, already accomplished before posing itself as a problem; every problem is internal to it. For whom would it be a problem? For a particular being who is part of it and would take it as an object—but for what end, except that of knowing it? That is in fact a particular end among many others. One may perhaps say that every problem is posed by the experience of life, or again that they express the specific demands of the different functions of consciousness as soon as they begin to exercise themselves, so that every problem is indeed a particular problem. They admit no other solution than relating each element of experience to all the others according to their synoptic or hierarchical order.

## 39. Centre
**The centre of method lies in the relation that must be established between the human being and the subject, or between the activity of participation and creative activity.**

Method is the work of the human being; yet in assuming the vocation of subject the human being binds itself to establish, among the different modes of subjectivity, a subordination it must strive to maintain within every operation it performs. It is up to the human being to make that subordination reign; it can do so only in time and through a series of obligations that constitute method itself. Method traces out for the human being the path it must follow if it is to discharge its role as subject.

The same idea can be expressed differently. For a method to be possible there must always be an interval between the one who applies it and the object to which it is applied—as we have just done in speaking of an interval between the human being and the subject.

One can also, using an earlier distinction (Prop. XV above), say that method presupposes an interval between reflective and creative activity. It seeks to join them and succeeds only if it describes the entire real that fills the interval—that is, the world—in such a way, however, that reflective activity, in striving to reduce it, comes to coincide with the creative activity whose role was to produce it. Hence—from one side—all the efforts whereby we want method to be a true reconstruction of the real, and—from the other—the classical schema of every method reduced to an analysis that must turn into a synthesis, to an induction which, once it reaches its term, is converted into deduction.

## 40. Position
**The subject can be placed outside the world but not outside being.**

We readily understand how one may place the subject outside the world in order that it may think the world. Within the hierarchy of subjects, the psychological subject is within the world for the transcendental subject, and the transcendental subject is within the world for the absolute subject. Yet the relation among the three subjects does not belong to the world considered as the given world constituted by phenomena—even though the subject can be posited only with reference to that world and in order to sustain it, which has inclined philosophers to posit this subject as purely formal. The subject, on the contrary, posits its own existence as the very condition of the existence of everything that may be posited, and which is posited only by and for it—that is, as phenomenon.

## 41. Scale
**The three aspects of the subject express a scale of participation, and, in ascending from one to the next, each becomes an object for the one above it.**

The subject can be considered under three different aspects. Insofar as it expresses a certain perspective on the world, it is itself within the world as the very centre of that perspective; at that moment it becomes an object among others. The world then becomes a shared experience, and as transcendental subject the subject is the author of that experience, just as, as psychological subject, it was the author of the individual perspective it adopted on the world. As the psychological subject inscribes itself within the transcendental activity it determines, so the transcendental subject inscribes itself within an absolute subject in whose laws every psychological subject participates. Consequently, just as the individual subject becomes an object among objects when referred to the transcendental subject, the transcendental subject becomes an idea among ideas when referred to the absolute subject.
