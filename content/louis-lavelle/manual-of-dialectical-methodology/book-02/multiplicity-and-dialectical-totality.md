## 72. Dialectic
**The word dialectic designates the method that seeks, in the relations among the different aspects of consciousness, the foundation of the relations among consciousnesses and, consequently, among things, ideas, and values.**

*Back to the table of contents*

Let us retain the word dialectic to designate the living method that seeks to analyse the very activity of consciousness, to penetrate the distinction among the different levels of the subject, so as to determine the relations among consciousnesses—relations that allow them to distinguish themselves on the plane of individuality, to recover their common laws on the plane of rationality, and to reach the concrete absolute in which they find the participated source of every operation and every datum expressed by the various degrees of participation. At each level of consciousness the dialectic rediscovers, horizontally, the connections among things, among ideas, or among values, and, vertically, the connections among values, ideas, and things. Only such a method can embrace the articulations among all the elements of the real; the order of inclusion never went beyond the indeterminate relation of part to whole, the constructive method never beyond the unilinear relation of simple to complex, and the method of unifying opposites never beyond the relation of opposition between the self and the not-self, ceaselessly posited and ceaselessly surmounted. The different aspects of the real, instead of adding themselves to one another indefinitely, form at every instant a sheaf: each maintains its heterogeneity within a regulated subordination of datum to operation, lower to higher, individual to reason, reason to the absolute, thing to idea, idea to value.

## 73. Connections
**That the different kinds of reality can be defined only through analysis suffices to justify their mutual connections within a regulated system where each relation may serve as a starting point, despite the distinctive, heterogeneous character of them all.**

The dialectic, as we describe it, is multilinear rather than unilinear. It does not pass from the same to the same through a progress from less to more, as if imitating in time the creation imagined as a passage from nothingness to being. In this organic systematisation of a reality that is full at every instant, each element calls upon the others for support, and it is the diversity of each that gives all of them their regulated place within the totality of Being. It matters little where one begins. Each relation through which one term calls forth another has an original character and not merely a particular position within some logical order that could be travelled in either direction but whose very sequence is unalterable. That is why the dialectical order is not an abstract order like the logical order, which is purely formal and must subsequently be applied to a certain matter in order to make knowledge possible. The dialectical order is a real order in which every operation is correlated with a datum. It is therefore also a metaphysical order, one that can justify itself only through its own accomplishment. It embraces every operation of thought and will, as well as the relations that unite them, rather than the artificial, constructive order that is valid only for certain kinds of knowledge or action and that always presupposes more complex relations with the real—relations that are implied and yet often left unacknowledged (as is shown by the formation of initial postulates, by the experience presupposed in the very discovery of an operation, or by the relation between an operation and its effect). Above all, it is often forgotten that the deepest and most constant acts of human life—especially those involving our relation with ourselves or with other beings—cannot be reduced to those constructive operations limited to the realm of quantity or to a world reducible to quantity.

## 74. Openness
**The dialectic is an open system, not a closed one.**

If the task of the dialectic is to describe the different conditions and forms of participation and then, within each of them, the correspondence between operation and datum, we understand why the dialectic necessarily constitutes a system. Founded on the unity of the absolute Act upon which every operation of each particular consciousness depends, this system is not a purely deductive system; it can be justified only by being carried out. There is no question here of enclosing the dialectic within a closed schema: it remains open because participation is inexhaustible, and because every new act of freedom discovers in the absolute a new response.

## 75. Categories
**The dialectic distributes, for each level of consciousness, a set of categories that govern both the operations and the data corresponding to that level.**

Every level of consciousness involves its own set of categories—at the level of sensation, of thought, of value. The dialectic assigns to each of these levels the categories appropriate to its activity and to the data in which that activity is mirrored. It thereby prevents the confusion of orders—an indispensable condition if we are to follow the articulations of participation without distorting them.

## 76. Operations
**For each category the dialectic determines an operation, and for each operation a corresponding datum.**

Categories are not empty forms; they refer to operations. Each operation, in turn, calls forth a datum that answers it. The dialectic therefore proceeds by pairing operations with the data that fulfil them. It is within this pairing that participation takes shape.

## 77. Faculties
**The dialectic assigns to each level of consciousness the faculty that exercises it.**

The psychological subject employs the faculties of sensation and desire, the transcendental subject those of understanding and will, and the absolute subject the pure act that precedes every distinction. The dialectic distributes these faculties according to the role they play in the different degrees of participation.

## 78. Senses
**One may even descend to the level of the sensible and find a dialectic of the senses.**

It is bold indeed to extend the dialectic of participation to the sensible level. Yet if the senses are instruments of knowledge that relate the individual consciousness to the concrete forms of existence, to quality itself, then the distribution of qualities must itself reflect a sensible realisation of the logical articulations of the real and of the operations through which the self seeks to apprehend it. Sight opens outward, presenting the external world in a vast spectacle, whereas hearing gives us sounds that exist only in duration and perhaps reveal duration to us. If we come closer to the body, touch reveals the boundary separating it from objects; touch is always a double sense (not only when it concerns bodily contact, as is so often claimed), since it simultaneously informs us of the touching and of the touched: the touched is the outside spread throughout space, whereas the touching is ourselves, that is, like every coenaesthetic sensation, both sensation and emotion insinuating themselves into the fabric of our becoming. After sight and hearing have revealed the body as their instrument, taste and smell seek within things themselves a secret affinity with us, offering it in flavour through a spatial weaving and in scent through a temporal wave. This almost classical list—save for one point where, considering that touch extends over the whole surface of the body, it is treated as a double sense, whether through its outer face it acquaints us with the contact of objects and body, or through its inner face it makes us aware, so to speak, of the presence and state of the body—cannot be considered exhaustive. The same method allows room for other senses newly discovered, whether through the analysis of more complex senses (as with touch and coenaesthesia) or through the composition of simpler senses (perhaps the case for the sense of orientation).

## 79. Convergence
**The different species of dialectic converge at their origin when they consider nothing but the most general conditions of the act of participation; they diverge as they move away from that origin and penetrate their own domain more deeply.**

The dialectical method is universal; it can be applied to every problem. It involves no rigidity. Because it always returns to the act of participation as the foundation of its operations, it inexorably rediscovers the same fundamental divisions at the outset. Yet it would be vain to establish afterwards some artificial symmetry among the particular divisions, for each specific application brings to light an irreducible mode of participation that must reveal the specific oppositions characteristic of that domain.

Communication among consciousnesses takes place within the dialectic, where the passage from the real to the possible and from the possible to the real occurs. This communication is more important than the one that allows us to evoke the ideas of things through an act of the intellect before showing how I can modify things through an act of will. Consciousnesses are thus united by properly spiritual relations—relations foreign to space and time, of which space and time are only the vehicles. Such relations would be impossible were the self reduced to the limits of individual subjectivity, did it not reside in the living relation that unites every individual subject within the absolute subject by means of the transcendental self.

## 80. Identity
**To be what one knows.**

There is a certain naiveté in the ancient affirmation that only the like knows the like, and it has been objected that there is knowledge only of the object—that what I know is solely the not-self. Some nuance is needed here. One willingly grants that the subject as such remains independent of every object and is not altered by the knowledge it has of the object, just as freedom, in its purity, is not sullied by any of the choices it has made. Matters are otherwise for the self. The self is essentially determined, and since it is inseparable from the consciousness it has of itself, one may say that it is nothing more than the very perspective—both theoretical and practical—it has on the world, rather than the mere focus of that perspective.

## 81. Subordination
**The world of phenomena and the world of ideas are subordinated to the world of beings.**

The guiding principle of this dialectic is the subordination not only of every psychological subject to the transcendental subject and of the transcendental subject to the absolute subject, but also of every form of reality—things and ideas alike—to the beings who perceive and think them. Things and ideas relate to one another as the psychological subject relates to the absolute subject; they are designed to secure among beings the most subtle distinctions along with the most delicate communications. It is the very task of the dialectic to follow them in all their detail.

## 82. Dialogue
**The dialectic is both a distribution and a dialogue.**

We must therefore retain for the word dialectic the twofold sense it had among the Greeks: it is a dialogue in which different consciousnesses enter into relation with one another, not to seek an identical term in which they would mutually abolish themselves, but to ground their very diversity within a unity that surpasses them. Such a dialogue is possible only thanks to the appearance of a multiplicity of objects of thought that each subject—and every subject—can posit as the end and limit of its own operation, thereby constituting a world open to all in which each may carve new paths. For this reason the dialectic is a dialogue pursued through a distribution not only of things but also of essences—that is, of things insofar as they become transparent to thought and surmount, as it were, the inaccessibility to which their individual uniqueness had previously consigned them.

## 83. Interiority
**Method does not consist in reconstructing a universe that becomes external to us, but in defining our relations with a universe within which we remain interior.**

The characteristic error of almost every method is to assume that reflection enables us to withdraw from the universe and then to reconstruct it by the sole power of our mind, as though it were a logical object akin to the work of an artisan. Method aspires to be a kind of creation of the world by thought. This is a superficial view, for reflection itself, even when it places itself outside the universe as represented—precisely because it makes the universe its object—cannot place itself outside being. Reflection is one of the modes of being; hence it can emancipate itself only by accounting for its own possibility—that is, by accounting for its relation with the whole of Being in which it is inscribed and of which its rôle is precisely to recover the different aspects together with the relations that link them. Method must therefore, instead of obliging us to place ourselves outside the universe, situate us within a universe whose different articulations with us it describes.
